Why this ebook? 
 
This textbook is aimed at West African students taking West African Senior School 
Certificate Examination (WASSCE) History Paper 1, “West Africa and the Wider World from 
Earliest Times to 2000”. This free resource covers all the current syllabus, as well as 
including two chapters (11. Women, Gender and Political Authority; 12. The Environment in 
West African History) which - it is hoped - might be later added. The authors hope that this 
content will allow secondary school students to gain a good overview of West African 
history as their syllabus defines it, and at the same time contribute to new debates. 
This textbook has been designed by matching up expertise and relevance of authors, 
geographical coverage for countries sitting the WASSCE exams, and ability to engage in 
collective work. Historians based in Ghana, Sierra Leone and The Gambia work here with 
Nigerian scholars in the diaspora. Together with this team are two colleagues selected for 
their particular expertise, from King’s College London.

Introduction 
 
In 1952, a group of British education experts met in Accra in the then Gold Coast, now 
Ghana, to establish the West African Examination Council (WAEC) to serve as the common 
examinations board for the five English speaking countries in British Colonial West Africa. 
The WAEC replaced the Cambridge and London Examination Boards which pupils in Ghana, 
Gambia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone sat to at the tail end of their secondary school careers. 
WAEC was at the time just one of several such transboundary institutions created by the 
departing British colonial rulers to bring the colonies closer; the other institutions were the 
West African Currency Board, the West African Airways, and the West African Frontier 
Force. It is an intriguing paradox that of these only WAEC has survived to this day and 
remains relevant 65 years after its creation. WAEC remains the sole examination body in the 
five Anglophone countries in West Africa (Liberia joined in 1974) and is serving its purpose 
very well so far. 
Yet, pupils who sit its exams yearly have in the past several decades faced severe shortage 
of reference materials to prepare them for the exams which will enable them to enter 
tertiary institutions. This is particularly true of subjects like history. In the 1960s and 1970s, 
governments in the WAEC member states promoted the study of history and encouraged 
historical research in the universities like Ibadan in Nigeria and Legon in Ghana which 
produced well known historians like Adu Boahen and Jacob Ajayi. They wrote reliable 
history textbooks books for secondary school pupils such as Boahen’s celebrated Topics in 
West African History (1966). 
Sadly, in the past two decades, as governments feel obliged to cut on education budgets in 
the name of structural adjustment, they have removed subjects like history from the list of 
priority areas of study in the schools (from 2009 to 2016, history was in fact removed from 
the curriculum in Nigeria!). History teachers find it difficult to get scholarships at teacher 
training colleges or under graduate levels. Local and international publishers like Longman 
or Afram no longer publish history text books. This has negatively affected the availability of 
trained history teachers and resource materials. 
Accordingly, secondary schools in WAEC countries no longer have access to dependable 
reference materials on either of the two components of the WAEC history syllabus- National 
Histories and West Africa and the Wider World. This has created a situation where teachers 
have become pamphleteers, photocopying or stitching together material which purports to 
cover the syllabus to sell to the pupils. These pamphlets are not only known for their crudity 
in terms of production but are of low standards; profuse with factual and grammatical 
errors. History pupils in some schools in The Gambia have to refer to up to five pamphlets as 
each history teachers has his own pamphlets which the pupils must buy. It this sad state of 
affairs which has dented students’ performance in this very important subject, which has 
encouraged us to embark on this project to produce reference materials on history for 
WAEC candidates in our schools. 
This basically is how the idea for this e-book started. Our aim is therefore to produce a 
dependable resource book covering the main aspect of the WAEC history syllabus for Senior 
Secondary Schools, namely, West Africa and the Wider World, and put it at the disposal of 
students and e. The students will find the material here presented absolutely useful as it is 
well researched and also written by people who are experts in the subject matter, and most 
of whom are prize winning history teachers, so to speak. This why every effort has been 
done to make the text student friendly with questions and fact boxes inserted to further 
assist the users. History teachers, who like their students, also suffer from chronic lack of 
useable reference material will also get a lot from this material while they await a teacher’s 
handbook which will surely accompany his book. Its online availability will assist students 
with any form of internet connection to access the material at no cost. 
We wish to thank all those whose participation has blessed this effort and made it possible, 
and all the many institutions without which it could not have happened: the University of 
Sierra Leone at Fourah Bay, where the initial meeting was hosted in May 2016; Kwame 
Nkrumah University of Science and Technology at Kumasi through the support of its History 
Department; the Ghana History Teachers’ Association; the University of The Gambia; and 
the funding which was provided by the Arts and Humanities Research Council of the United 
Kingdom, the African Studies Association of the UK, and King’s College London’s Department 
of History and Faculty of Arts and Humanities, all of which has made this possible. 
Work started on the project in late 2015 when the chapters were identified and assigned to 
the writers. Through a flurry of emails between the co-ordinators Hassoum Ceesay in the 
Gambia and Dr. Toby Green in UK, preparations for the first writers meeting were 
completed and held in Freetown, Sierra Leone in May 2017. There the parameters for the e-
book such as house style, and final content were agreed upon and deadlines set for the 
chapters. It was also agreed in Freetown that the e-book will be launched at Banjul, Gambia 
in the margins of the WAEC General Meeting in March 2018 – we wish also to than our 
brothers and sisters at WAEC for facilitating this presentation so that it has come to pass 
today. 
We wish to recommend this book to all our brothers, sisters studying history in our schools. 
In this effort by a handful of experts from across the region, they should get heart and 
courage that history, as a subject, still matters to all the national development efforts of the 
countries in WAEC. In other words, history is also a developmental subject which can help 
our economies grow through job creation in sectors like museums, heritage, tourism, 
hospitality amongst others. Historians can be the best public administrators also, and the 
most enlightened politicians. Above all, a study of history helps to give the teeming youth in 
our new nations a sense of identity and purpose which we know they need in order not to 
risk their lives across the Mediterranean Sea or end up being auctioned crudely in Libyan 
slave marts!

1 - Historiography and Historical Skills 
 
THE WRITING OF HISTORY 
The historian’s goal is not to collect the “facts” about the past but rather to acquire insights 
into the ideas and realities that shaped the past of lives of men and women of earlier 
societies. Some of the beliefs and institutions of the past may seem alien to us, others may 
also seem too familiar. But in either case, when we study the people of the past, what we 
are really learning about is the rich diversity of human experience. The study of history, 
however, is the study of the beliefs and desires, practices and institutions of human beings. 
African history is the study of the past institutions and cultures of the people who live in 
Africa. The economic, political and social activities of the people who had once lived in 
Africa are studied under African history. The following is the importance of studying African 
history. 
i. The study of history like other disciplines help some individuals to earn a living (career 
aspect). It serves as a source of employment for people who study the subject at a higher 
level. 
ii. The study of African history has helped in the discovery of the activities of man in far off 
times. Africa has been proved by researchers like Dr. Louis Leakey to be the original home of 
man (Homo sapiens). The study of African history would lead to more discoveries of hidden 
facts. It will highlight Africa’s contribution to world civilization. 
iii. The study of African history gives the individual the opportunity to relate his past with 
the present in a better way. Thus, the various stages of society’s development that has to be 
evaluated to understand the present situation. One will best understand the social, 
economic and political state of affairs of the society if they knows how things were done in 
the past. This gives them the key to find solutions to today’s problems. 
iv. African history has addressed the notion and misconception that Africa has contributed 
insignificantly to history and to dispel the idea of white superiority, e.g., the Hamitic 
hypothesis assumed that the African ‘Hamites’ were ‘whites’ akin to the European as they 
and their culture were inherently superior to the Black Africans and their culture, so that 
wherever Black Africans had apparently made a striking advance, the explanation must be 
sought in ‘Hamitic’ influence. Early Arab and European travelers met Africans in different 
cultural setting. The African has distinctive names, music and dances, political and religious 
settings as well as rites of passage. Because these practices did not conform to the cultural 
practices of the Europeans and the Arab writers, they classified Africans as primitive, 
backward or culturally stagnant. 
v. African history enables the student to develop a critical mind and appreciate the variety 
of human behavior and motives and understand politics, economics and society. In this 
respect, history in the African context can increase human tolerance and respect for 
differences in opinion. Knowledge of other cultures through the appreciation of history 
encourages students of history to engage in critical analysis of their own culture and society 
and to understand and criticize their own assumptions. 
vi. The study of African history is beneficial since it helps to acquire knowledge about African 
traditions, culture, norms, and values and to take pride in them and present them. One is 
able to perceive and recognize the meaning of events from a perspective other than our 
own to appreciate the diversity of human beliefs and cultures. 
vii. African history enables the history student to acquire knowledge of their own country 
and the African continent. 
viii. African history has a practical use in international relations and diplomacy. Its study 
promotes international understanding and sympathy. 
ix. Studying African history will enable the history student to acquire the skills and values 
that our past can give. African history students can be inspired by events and deeds of great 
people that will instill in them a sense of pride. 
x. A proper examination of the past can tell us a great deal about how we came to be who 
we are. 
xi. One studies African history to be able to appreciate the use of other sources in the 
writing and reconstruction of African history apart from written sources. 
xii. It enables the student to develop an accurate sense of African historical chronology. 
 
SOURCES OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
Most rural communities in countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, The Gambia and 
Ghana obtain their drinking water from streams or hand dug wells. One may describe such 
streams and wells as a community’s source of water supply. Similarly, historians use the 
term historical sources to refer to the means by which historical information is gotten. 
Again, by historical sources, the historian means traces that the past has left of itself in the 
present, in the form of document, artifacts, buildings, castles and forts, coins, institution, 
traditions, festivals, customs and so forth. 
 
TYPES OR SOURCES OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
There are two sources for the writing of history. They are the primary and the secondary 
sources 
• Primary sources 
Primary sources are materials produced by the people or groups directly involved in the 
event or topic under discussion, ether as participants or as witnesses. Some primary sources 
are written documents such as letters, diaries, newspaper and magazine articles, speeches, 
autobiographies, treatise, census data and marriage, birth and death registers. In addition, 
historians often examine primary sources that are not written. Examples are works of art, 
films, recordings, items of clothing, household objects, tools and archaeological remains. 
• Oral sources (interviews) and eyewitness accounts can be used as primary sources. 
 
DOCUMENTARY OR WRITTEN SOURCES OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
This refers to documents or written accounts which give information about past events 
concerning people. Examples of documentary sources are: 
i. Newspapers 
ii. Diaries 
iii. Travelers’ account 
iv. Journals 
v. Reports of commissions of enquiry 
vi. Manifesto parties 
vii. Government official records 
viii. Minutes of meetings 
ix. Private letters 
x. Official reports of officers 
xi. Court records 
xii. Books 
xiii. Anniversary brochures 
xiv. Tributes 
xv. Magazines etc 
IMPORTANCE OR ADVANTAGES OF WRITTEN SOURCES OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
i. Easy To Use 
It is easier to use written sources in the reconstruction of African history. This is because 
books or documents can often be carried from one place to another where the reader or 
the writer wants to use it. This cannot be done in the non-documentary sources. 
ii. Accurate and Reliable Facts 
Written records of contemporary issues give first-hand information which is naturally more 
accurate and reliable. This is because dates and events are chronologically well recorded. 
For example minutes of meetings give exact and accurate date, and the time the meeting 
was held. Similarly, records written in diaries are recorded on the spot as events occur or 
soon after. This helped historians to know the exact dates for instance the Asante fought 
with the British because the wars were documented. Written sources help reduce any 
tendency of the historian to use guesswork in his work. 
iii. Effective Means of Keeping Records 
Keeping accurate records of events is very difficult especially where written sources are 
lacking and people rely solely on oral tradition. One can say therefore that written sources 
are more effective means or method of keeping records of past events. 
iv. Promotion of Research 
Written sources of African history promote research work. For instance, when readers feel 
that there is a deficiency in a written account, they are encouraged to dig further in order to 
contribute to greater and more accurate knowledge about the issue. 
v. Help Cross-Checking Information 
Written sources help in cross-checking data or information collected from oral and other 
sources of historical knowledge. This help to reach reliable conclusions. 
vi. Provision of Detailed Information 
Documents provide more detailed information than oral sources, e.g. dates, illustrative 
pictures, names of participants in events etc.. 
 
WEAKNESSES/DISADVANTAGES/LIMITATIONS OF WRITTEN SOURCES OF AFRICAN 
HISTORY 
i. Easily Destroyed 
Written sources can easily be destroyed by termites, rodents, fire, flood, earthquakes, 
humidity, etc. Written records destroyed by any of these disasters cannot be retrieved 
unlike oral sources which can be retold. Termites and rodents may also eat away vital 
information in written forms. 
ii. Condition Biases and Distortions 
Another major limitation of written sources of history is that they may contain biases and 
distortions. The writer may intentionally write to suit his opinions or leave out some aspects 
of the events which are not to his liking. For example some books written by European 
writers state that slave trading is a blessing to the people of West Africa. Others have 
written in their books that until the coming of Europeans in West Africa, the history of West 
Africa was only wars and misery. 
iii. False Information 
Again, one of the strongest demerit of written source is, once certain materials or 
information have been written down, people take them to be as fact even when they are 
not crosschecked. Not all the information found in writing or books should be taken to be 
historical truth; there could be a little bit of exaggeration, bias or prejudice. 
iv. Expensive 
Written materials are expensive. The writer needs materials like paper, pen, book, diary, etc 
to put down events. Also, before one gets written materials, they may have to make use of 
the other sources like archeology, linguistics etc. 
v. Difficult to get 
Once again, written materials are hard to come by, especially in Africa where the art of 
writing started late. Even in Africa where they are available, they are fragmentary and far 
between. Since writing began very late in Africa apart from ancient Egypt, written records 
are generally scanty and scarce. This means that the historian has to rely more on the non-
documentary sources, making the work more difficult. 
vi. Getting Lost 
Written materials can get lost, thus depriving the people the historical information if they 
are the only sources of information. 
vii. Illiteracy 
Documentary sources are written materials that have been put into writing and to be able 
to read one needs to be literate (able to read and write). Many Africans cannot read nor 
write, hence rendering written sources of African history deficient in the reconstruction of 
African history. 
viii. Consult Experts 
Finally, to come out with authentic written materials, the services of experts in the other 
disciplines like archeology, linguistics, etc. are needed in order to interpret correctly 
historical events. 
 
NON DOCUMENTARY OR UNWRITTEN SOURCES OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
This refers to pieces of information about past events collected from sources of history 
other than books and other written materials. This explains why this section refers to 
unwritten sources. Examples of non-documentary sources are Archaeology, Oral Tradition, 
Linguistic, Ethnography, Art forms/History, Ethnobotany, Ethnozoology, Ethnomusicology, 
Numismatics, and Serology. 
 
ORAL TRADITION AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
Oral tradition refers to accounts of the traditions about the past passed from generation to 
generation by word of mouth or other methods. It is usually passed on in the form of a 
story, legend, song, myth, folk tales, customs or other forms of music. There are two forms 
of oral traditions: 
1. The Fixed Text Type 
2. Free Text Type 
The fixed text type of oral traditions have an unchanging format and content and have to be 
memorized and passed on from generation to generation. Example of ‘fixed text’ type are 
words of folk music, praise songs, drum music and horn music. 
An example of drum music is the Mpintin drums of Denkyira which recall the past hegemony 
and wealth of that state in two terse lines: ‘kotoko som amponsem’ (the porcupine i.e. 
Asante serves Amponsem-the king of Denkyira) and ‘Boa Amponsem a odi sika atomprada’ 
(King Boa Amponsem who uses fresh gold all the time). 
Similarly, Abuakwa horn music immortalize the valour of Abuakwa’s Queen Dokuaa at the 
Akatamanso (1826) they sing ‘Dokua obaa basia a oko oprem ano’ (Dokua the valiant 
woman who fought before canon). 
The free-text type consists of accounts of events usually stool (dynastic) histories and family 
or village traditions. For example some court officials can memorize some aspects of the 
state history and can tell others when necessary. Some court officials include the linguist 
(okyeame), court heralds (esen) and executioners (abrafo) in the Akan states. Also, in Mali 
the (griot) and Togo (evne) played similar roles. 
MERITS/ADVANTAGES/BENEFITS OF ORAL TRADITION AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
i. Easily Accessible 
Oral tradition is easily accessible in the sense that, gathering information by the historian 
does not involve much work. In every community, town or village in Africa, one can get 
some elders who are ready to give the traditions and historical events in the area. The 
historian in one way or the other, only need to contact knowledgeable informants and 
respondents for the necessary information needed. 
ii. Main Source of History 
In the absence of other sources, oral tradition becomes one of the sole sources of writing 
history. In a situation where there are no written records or other pieces of information like 
personal diaries, minutes of meetings, journals etc. the historian often relies to a large 
extent on the information provided by oral tradition to compile his findings. 
iii. Helps Other Sources 
Oral tradition as a source of African history has helped to confirm historical facts from other 
sources. For example, it helps the archeologist to confirm their findings thus throwing more 
light on the findings of the history of a place. Again, the archaeologist would have to be 
directed by a story from the local people before he goes to excavate the site. Therefore, 
without oral tradition, the archaeologist’s work become difficult. 
iv. Historical Trends and Events 
Oral tradition helps the historian to determine historical trends and events. Through the 
comparison of several oral traditions, the historian can eliminate biases, inconsistencies or 
inaccuracies in the written records they are using, to come out with an accurate historical 
account of the past. 
v. Interpretation of Archeological Findings 
Oral tradition has also helped in the interpretation of archeological data dug from the soil. 
This is necessary because the artefacts found are both anonymous and fragmentary. For 
instance, if an archaeologist unearthed human skeletons with lost limbs apparently severed 
by sharp-edged materials, they may deduce that the excavated site was a mass grave where 
people who died after an armed conflict were buried. They may not conclude with that, but 
rather validate their evidence by embarking upon personal enquiry, interviewing target 
groups in the area. If they are lucky, they would have pieces of information about events 
similar to what they have speculated. 
vi. Preservation of History 
Oral tradition has done a lot to assist with the reconstruction of African history, this is 
because Africans have relied on oral traditions to preserve their history for centuries. It is 
again, the only living source of historical reconstruction because it gives room for further 
questioning and analysis of the information given to ensure its validity or truthfulness. 
 
DEMERITS/DISADVANTAGES/LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES/DEFECTS OF ORAL TRADITION 
AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
i. Not Precise in Detail 
In the first instance, oral tradition is not precise in detail. The narrator may give information 
in a long clumsy way without any specific point. Important aspect of events and their 
sequences are forgotten as the informants advance in age. As these stories are retold to 
subsequent generations, they are filled with misrepresentation of facts. 
ii. Exaggerations 
Oral tradition is full of exaggeration, biases and prejudices. The narrator might add 
irrelevant information or might leave out information which does not suit his interest. 
Narrators normally leave out these aspects of the story consciously or unconsciously leading 
to one-sided information that cannot serve as a sound basis for historical writing. 
iii. Inaccurate Figures 
Moreover, oral tradition cannot be dated with certainty. The narrator might forget part of 
the events or important dates. People tend to lose track of events through no fault of theirs 
and therefore forget the actual date and time that a particular event took place. For 
instance, situations where an event occurs frequently, it brings confusion in terms of 
specifics since the narrator does a lot of guesswork. 
iv. Death of Informants 
Another shortfall of oral tradition is that, death or calamity affecting people can result in the 
loss of important aspect of oral tradition since only the living can tell it and not the dead. To 
top it up, if people were afflicted by a calamity leading to the loss of lives including the key 
informants, then the information of the affected area would be lost forever. 
v. Mixing Up Facts 
Furthermore in using oral tradition as the main source of reconstruction of African history, 
details and sequences of events might be forgotten with the passage of time since the 
human mind keeps the history, one might forget some important points as years pass by. 
vi. Difficult to Cross-Check 
Indeed cross-checking becomes difficult in oral tradition if the narrator is the only source of 
information. It is a fact that oral tradition is most likely to contain inaccuracies and failures 
to collaborate the information gathered from other source might produce shoddy work 
hence the need to cross-check and test events. 
vii. Emphasis On Personalities And Events 
Oral tradition tends to lay more emphasis on personalities like kings, rulers and leaders as 
well as events like wars and migration to the neglect of social and economic aspects of 
people’s history, thus making the historical approach somewhat narrow, to the 
disadvantages of scholarship and posterity. 
viii. Oral traditionists are men, and thus there is a gendered bias in what is recalled, and the 
way it is recalled, which may diminish the role women have played in the African past. 
 
ARCHAEOLOGY AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
Archaeology is the study of a people’s culture of years past through excavation and 
examination of material remains that are found. It is the understanding of human actions in 
the past through a study of what they did rather than what they said of themselves. Again, 
archaeology provides information about how societies adapted their ways of life to suit 
their natural environment or how they modified their environment to suit their way of life. 
Archaeological information is obtained through the excavation or digging of specially chosen 
sites. 
In Europe, archaeology has been a useful source of historical evidence since the 19th 
century AD whereas in Africa, it has been helpful in the reconstruction of the past since the 
second half of the 20th century. 
The archaeologist uses radio-carbon dating (carbon-14 dating) to determine the age of 
artefacts. The use of this technique to examine running of houses tools and weapons etc. 
has contributed immensely towards the reconstruction of African history. Among the 
evidences are the famous Ife works of art in bronze and pottery, which came to the notice 
of the world through archeological excavations in 1910. Secondly, excavated sites at Igbo 
Ukwu in the south of Enugu-Nigeria has shown that a highly advanced society existed in that 
part of Nigeria in the 10th century AD. Thirdly, in the Brong-Ahafo region of modern Ghana, 
excavation conducted at Begho provided evidence of copper and iron industries. However 
there are many important sites in West Africa such as Kantora on the Upper Gambia river 
and Kansala – capital of the Kaabu empire in north-eastern Guinea-Bissau – which still 
require excavation. 
 
BENEFITS/IMPORTANCE/ADVANTAGES/MERITS/STRENGTHS OF ARCHAEOLOGY 
i. Existence of Civilization Long Ago 
Archaeological information shows that African societies attained high levels of civilization 
and development in pre European time. Example is the site excavated at Igbo Ukwu and Ife 
in Nigeria which have revealed highly advanced societies where bronze and pottery 
technology were practiced. 
ii. Trade Contacts 
Archeology helps to reveal the kind of trade contacts that existed among people in the past. 
A good example is that of the excavations carried out at Begho in the Brong Ahafo region of 
Ghana, which showed that long before the arrival of the Europeans, Africans were in contact 
with China, Indonesia, Arabia and Phoenicia, since porcelain, coins, pipes and bottles from 
these areas were found. 
iii. Revelation of Culture 
Through the studies of archaeology we get an idea about the political organization of 
people, their religious/traditional beliefs and economic activities etc. These come to light 
when archaeologists excavate materials which experts examine and relate them. For 
instance, if a chief’s linguist staff is found after excavations one may relate it to 
religious/traditional belief or authority. 
iv. Ancient Tools 
Archeology also provides information about the way different people have adapted to their 
environment e.g. by revealing the tools they made for various purposes. 
v. Make Other Sources Clear 
Archeologists help to confirm what can be known from other sources e.g. Oral Tradition 
vi. Main sources of Pre-History 
Archaeology has helped historians to write history of pre-historic times. Since writing began 
late in most parts of the continent, archeology has become the main source of information 
for the reconstruction of African history of the distant past. 
vii. How Ancient people lived 
Archeologists have revealed in their studies what our ancestors did and so help to provide 
useful evidence for writing about. Through archeology, the material culture of people in the 
past becomes known. It is only to excavations that we go to know the kind of building 
people built and the occupation they engaged in. For example, the ruins in Zimbabwe, 
Kumbi-Saleh (empire of Ghāna) and the pyramids in Egypt. 
viii. Origin of Humanity 
Archeological studies have shown that human beings originated from Africa. From this 
source, it has been proved that Africa was the first home of man (Homo sapiens). This has 
been proved by the fossils discovered by Dr. and Mrs. Leakey at Olduvai Gorge in the 
Northern Tanzania. 
ix. Dates of Events 
Archeological studies help us to date event e.g. the use of carbon-14 dating or radio carbon 
dating. 
x. Reliable Source 
It has been a reliable source of history since artifacts could be seen and felt. 
 
DEMERITS/DISADVANTAGES/LIMITATIONS OF ARCHAEOLOGY 
i. Guess work 
In archaeology, one is bound to use much guess work in the reconstruction of the past, thus 
leading to inaccurate information. Also, the use of radio-carbon dating always approximate 
dates. Artifacts found are anonymous and lack the sequence of daily life. Makers and users 
of such artifacts are usually not known. This makes the archeologist do guesswork. 
ii. Very Expensive 
The use of archaeology as a source of writing African history is expensive. It is expensive 
considering high cost of labour excavating machines, finding the selected site, getting 
permit, laboratory expenses, and special tools among others. The use of the radio carbon 
dating (carbon 14) in determining the age of an archaeological find is very complex and 
expensive. 
iii. Nature of the Climate/Climate Condition 
The nature of the tropical climate in Africa makes it difficult for archeological findings 
(material remains) to be preserved in the soil. The tropical rainforest has high temperature 
and rainfall which promotes decay of fossil remains as well as chemical weathering. These 
conditions facilitate fossil decay and weathering of rocks leaving little or no traces of rock 
paintings or carvings which are very useful sources of information to historians in their 
attempt to reconstruct the African past. 
iv. Accidental preservation 
One major limitation of archeology is that the means by which information is preserved is 
not deliberate, so most of the findings discovered through excavations are accidental. With 
this we have the intuition of acquiring some knowledge, but would first at the same time be 
‘gambling’. 
v. View not comprehensive 
Archaeological finding is unable to provide a comprehensive view and analysis of the past 
because it does not tell about the ideological and sociological aspects of life. All these 
factors limit the scope of information available to the historian. 
vi. Spotty information 
The information derived from archeology is often spotty because the information is usually 
got depending on materials found. 
vii. Difficult to interpret 
Archeology unfortunately needs knowledge of many disciplines to interpret information. For 
example, chemistry, botany, geology, art, history etc. That is, it is not easy to get one person 
with knowledge on such disciplines thus making interpretation a difficult task. 
viii. Depend on other sources 
Archeology rely on information given by oral tradition and written sources. The 
archeologists in most cases have to receive information about a site or read from a book 
about a site before excavations can take place. Without receiving information from the local 
people about a site of ruins, writing African history becomes difficult since the archeologist 
may be handicapped. 
 
LINGUSITICS AS A SOURCE OF WRITING AFRICAN HISTORY 
Linguistics is the scientific study of the origin, structure and changes of a language that 
occur in the languages over a period of time. Languages do change in vocabulary and 
grammar over periods of time. Such changes can tell the historian about the adoption of 
new ideas by people. Some languages, when studied closely relate to the other (Ga and 
Adangbe; Wali and Dagari; Ewe and Fon; Fante and Bono; and Dagomba and Mossi etc.). 
One could project that those languages may have developed from one single parent 
language. The comparative study of such related languages can provide useful information. 
 
MERITS/ADVANTAGES OF LINGUISTICS 
Linguistics study has several advantages and importance in the reconstruction of African 
history. 
i. Origin of ethnic group 
Linguistics helps us to trace the origin of people and peopling of places e.g. Ewe, Akan, 
Bantu etc. Studies conducted by one linguist J.H.Greenberg into the origin of the Bantu and 
other West African languages have helped to arrive at the conclusion that the then Bantu 
speakers dispersed throughout the eastern and southern Africa originate from the Nigerian-
Cameroon border region. 
ii. Confirmation of Origin 
Linguistic studies can help confirm or question stories of origin e.g. Ewe as against Ga stories 
of origin from east of Ghana. In reconstructing Africa’s history, linguistics has confirmed the 
established facts that Ewes once stayed with the Yoruba at Ketu, Benin and Togo before 
settling in Ghana. This can be found in the language of Ewe speakers in the West African 
countries. 
iii. Identification of ethnic groups 
Linguistics helps in identifying people into ethnic groups e.g. Ewe, Akan, Ga-Adange etc. 
indeed language plays very key role in identifying a group of people. For instance, it is the 
Ewe people that speak the Ewe language; also Twi is spoken by the Asantes. 
iv. Borrowing of words 
Linguistics again helps to throw light on the relationships that have existed between peoples 
e.g. existence of common words would point to exchanges between people otherwise not 
related. Also, a good example is the Akan words for political and other affairs in the Ga 
language, and words of Mande origin in Twi and other West African languages. Foreign 
influence 
Furthermore, linguistics enlightens us on the influences that have come to people from 
outside, e.g. the existence of Portuguese words in Ghanaian languages like paano (bread), 
bokiti (bucket), asopatre (slippers), krataa (paper) and prete (plate). 
vi. New ideas 
Linguistics helps us to show the adoption of new ideas by people with changes in vocabulary 
and grammar. The changes that occur in languages can be studied to tell whether there has 
been an adoption of new ideas and general historical developments. Example, Akan words 
in Ga language like ‘anokwaley’, ‘abotaley’ etc. 
vii. Emergence from the same source 
Linguistic studies of the Bantu and West African languages have established that the 
ancestors of modern Bantu speakers originated from the Nigeria-Cameroon border area. 
The study of related languages may show that they emerged from the same source, 
probably a proto-language called ‘Kwa’. 
viii. Related languages 
Through the study of linguistics, historians can establish whether speakers of closely-related 
languages have a common root e.g. Ga and Adangbe,Wali and Dagari; Ewe and Fon; Fante 
and Bono; and Dagomba and Mossi. Professor Abena Dolphyne of the University of Ghana 
has studied Akan languages of the Asante, Fante and Bono. She concluded that the Bono 
language is more related to the Fante language than any of the two of the Asante language. 
This is confirmed by the oral tradition of the Fante that they stayed aTakyiman before 
moving to their present home. 
 
DEMERTIS/LIMITATIONS OF LINGUISTICS 
i. Difficult to study 
It is difficult to study and analyze a particular language if the researcher does not have fore 
knowledge about it. Linguistics is such a complex study that there is very little unanimity or 
agreement among even the linguists themselves on their conclusions. 
ii. Changes may not help 
Linguistics cannot clearly point out changes in language over a period of time. This can lead 
to misrepresentation, loss or distortion of reality in history, thus making it very difficult to 
know the true origins or events needed by the writer. 
iii. Less developed in Africa 
Linguistics fell short in reconstruction of African history, because as a discipline it is less 
developed in Africa. Hence, it does not contribute very much like other sources in the 
writing of African history.That notwithstanding, in recent times, linguists in USA and 
elsewhere are researching on African history. 
iv. Rely on other sources 
Linguistics in most cases, the historian has to largely rely on the other sources for validation 
and collaboration of information obtained. 
v. Coincidence in word usage 
Some conclusions drawn by linguists based on words similarities may be sheer coincidence. 
In such cases, finding conclusive evidence remains difficult. 
 
ETHNOGRAPHY/ETHNOLOGY AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
Ethnography is the study of present-day social institutions as well as the crafts and artistic 
skills of people. Example is the collaboration of festivals, the process of making pottery, 
beads, weaving, construction etc. 
ADVANTAGES/IMPORTANCE OF ETHNOGRAPHY 
i. Understand the Present Day Technology 
The conclusions drawn from the study and examination of these institutions and artefacts in 
examination of these institutions and artefacts in their present form help towards fully 
understanding and explain the past’s influence on the formation of present 
skills/techniques. 
ii. Understand the Past 
The conclusions drawn from the study and examination of these institutions and artefacts in 
examination of these institutions and artefacts in their present form help to fully 
understand and explain the past. 
iii. Study Festivals 
Ethnography provides a useful opportunity to study Africa rituals and festivals which are 
mainly re-enactment of historical event (for example, the performance of the warriors 
during the Egungun festival of the Yoruba). Also, if the performance by the Alaketu (ruler of 
Ketu) during his installation demonstrate a play-back of the experiences of the first Alaketu 
in establishing Ketu state. Similarly, among the Ewes the Hogbetsotso festival is celebrated 
annually to commemorate their exodus and liberation from the tyrannical rule of Togbui 
Agorkoli I of Notsie. 
 
DEMERITS OF ETHNOGRAPHY 
i. Not easy to get meanings 
One of the defects of ethnography is the study of present day social institution does not give 
the exact meanings to some traditional practices. The fast modernization and 
westernization of our traditional values may have swept away some important aspect of our 
cultural heritage. 
ii. Tracing ancestry 
Africans are able through ethnography to trace their ancestry or record some important 
events like Homowo, Hogbetsotso, Egungun festival. 
iii. Influence of religions 
Introduction of Christianity and Islam into African traditional society have slighted 
concentration in the celebration of traditional festivals and rites. Instead, there is more 
celebration of Christmas, Easter, Eid-il-fitr among others 
NUMISMATICS AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
Numismatics is the study of coins. This study helps us to know where the coins were minted 
and found. 
i. Advanced economy 
Numismatics studies has proved that Africans had an advanced economy in minting of coins. 
Numismatics throws light on trade contacts between people. For an example the discovery 
of 240 coins at Kilwa on the East African Coast show that from the 13th century AD, the 
sultans of Kilwa had their own mint. 
ii. Accurate date 
Numismatic gives accurate dates, names, places and events. For example the king list of 
Kilwa came to light when the 240 coins were discovered. It showed the sultans of the 
Swahili Coast. 
iii. Reliable 
Discovered coins can be seen, felt or touched, makes history live, or more interesting or 
reliable. 
iv. High level of civilization 
Numismatics shows the level of civilization to the people using coins. For instance, by the 
13th century AD, the Sultans of the East African Coast had their own mint of coins for 
producing their coins for trade and other purposes. Also, gold weights represented the 
means of determining quantities of gold in Akan society where gold dust was the normal 
currency. The value of gold to be used in a money transaction was assessed by weights. 
v. Political dominance 
Numismatics shows the political dominance in societies using coins. During the colonial rule, 
Ghana’s currency had the figure and name of the British crown. 
vi. Preservation for longer periods. 
Numismatics unlike the other artifacts, a coin can be preserved for a relatively longer 
period. 
vii. Trade links 
Through the activities of numismatics, it is known that as far back as the 9th and 10th 
centuries AD, the people of East Africa and China had established trading links. 
DEMERITS OF NUMISMATICS 
i. Gives limited information 
Numismatics gives limited information in the story it tells. It may only identify a ruling class 
in the society engaged in trading activity who used the coin. This makes numismatics 
handicapped in tracing the other aspects of cultural lives of the user societies. 
ii. Rely on other sources 
Without the consultation of other sources like archeology and oral tradition, numismatics 
may somehow be impotent in revealing the entire cultural history of a society. This is also 
because not all pre-historic societies minted and used coins. 
 
ETHNOBOTANY AND ETHNOZOOLOGY AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
Ethnobotany is the scientific study of ancient remains of plants which are termed flora. 
Ethnozoology is the scientific study of animal remains from the past which are called fauna. 
These studies help to trace the origins of plants and the animals our ancestors fed on and 
exploited in the past. It is through such studies that crops are classified as indigenous and 
non-indigenous. 
 
ADVANTAGES OF ETHNOBOTANY AND ETHNOZOOLOGY 
i. Advance in Agriculture 
Through the study of ethnobotany, it has been established that, Africans were advanced in 
agriculture. For example ethnobotany has revealed that, the (Dahomey Gap) in modern 
Benin in West African coastal forest belt is the cradle of yam cultivation. Also animals like 
West African dwarf goat, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats and guinea fowl are all indigenous to Africa. 
ii. Contacts of people 
Ethnobotany shows the interrelationships or contacts among peoples and the presence of 
some crops and fruits like guava, tangerine, mango, avocado pear and pineapple are known 
to have European origins. It has been observed that, the Bantu had for a long time relied on 
banana as a food source and therefore it has been suggested that the spread of banana to 
other parts of Africa had depended to a large extent on the migration of the Bantu. 
iii. Determines settlement of people 
Ethnobotany and ethnozoology help to locate settlement of people. Certain plants and 
animals determine settlement of people since generation after generation has used them as 
staple foods and diets. 
iv. Dating events 
The study of ethnobotany and ethnozoology has helped in dating events in the society. 
v. Tree-ring dating 
Ethnobotany has helped historians through the use of tree-ring dating method. It is the 
method used to date pieces of wood that are found in excavations to determine the ages of 
their use. 
 
DEMERITS OF ETHNOBOTANY AND ETHNOZOOLOGY 
i. Inaccuracy in prediction 
The information about crop and animals being indigenous or non-indigenous may not be 
accurate. This is because weather and climatic conditions as well as the duration of the crop 
in a particular area might be so long that there is the likelihood of inaccurate prediction. 
ii. Generalizations 
A remarkable problem associated with ethnobotany is generalization. For instance it is 
established that Tetteh Quarshie brought cocoa to Ghana from Fernando Po but another 
source have it that the Basel missionaries brought cocoa from Surinam before Tetteh 
Quarshie. It will be incorrect to generalize that cocoa came to Ghana from Fernando Po or 
Surinam because the climatic condition in these places are the same. 
iii. Depend on the Other Sources 
Ethnobotanist must work in conjunction with other sources of writing African history before 
they can establish the validity or otherwise of their find. Without this inter-disciplinary 
approach, ethnobotany will be impotent. 

ETHNOMUSICOLOGY AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
Ethnomusicology is the scientific study of music (musicology) which focuses on the study of 
music forms in their cultural perspective. It deals with the role of music in the cultural 
history of a group of people, and how the formal structures of music evolve in different 
historical contexts. 
i. Confirmation of Events 
Ethnomusicology confirms and supports events of history. Most folk songs and ancient 
musical forms usually make reference to important socio-economic events and political 
events in the life of the people who composed and sang them. E.g. the Asafo songs of the 
Fante make references to the exploits of their three warlords which included, 
Obunumakoma, Odapagyan and Oson. Also, the Akyem Abuakwa’s warrior Queenmother 
Dokuah’s role in the courageous woman who fights with the gun. This describes Dokuah’s 
contribution to the Akyem Abuakwa state. Similarly, in Mande peoples, the epic of Sunjata 
Keita recounts the formation of the empire of Mali. 
ii. Storehouse of Information 
It is also a storehouse of historical information in the form of drums, horn, music, dirges and 
praise songs. For instance, during the Damba festival of the Dagombas, they play drums that 
give messages about Toharjie-the great warrior who led them to their present settlements. 
Drums are one of the Africa’s great living books. 
iii. Changes Occur In Music 
The study of the changes that occur in people’s musical forms over a period of time is also 
another source of history, for example, a study of the religious songs of the Ga has revealed 
that the music as well as the song belongs to an older and different ethnic group. This 
supports the claim of Guan oral tradition that they occupied the highlands of the Ga state 
prior to the arrival of the Ga. Moreover the change in African musical instruments in the 
New World has given much information about diaspora history. 
 
DEMERITS OF ETHNOMUSICOLOGY 
i. Lyrics authenticity 
One major defects of ethnomusicology is the authenticity of the text or lyrics the song 
conveyed. 
ii. Difficult to trace the origins of songs 
Another shortfall of ethnomusicology is that there is no African culture ever developed a 
notational system for its organization of culturally defined musical sound. This implies there 
is little hope in hearing African music with any accuracy of tracing the actual sound of music 
to any substantial time-depth. 
 
ARTS FORMS/ARTS HISTORY AS A FORM OF AFRICAN HISTORY. 
Art history is the study of art forms such as engravings, paintings, carvings and sculpture on 
stone surface, tombs, slabs or walls of caves, palaces and shrines. 
ADVANTAGES OF ART HISTORY 
i. Activities of human beings 
Arts forms or history helps to discover the economic activities, religious beliefs, culture and 
political power a group of people had in the past. For instance, the art works found in the 
Tassili Caves suggest that the dry areas of North Africa might not have been as dry in the 
past as they are today. 
ii. Eating Habits 
Paintings of food crops found in the tombs in the Sahara give impressions that the early 
inhabitants of these region might have relied on grains as food source. This helps historians 
to know and determine the eating habits and occupations of the early inhabitants of the 
Saharan regions. 
iii. Life in the Sahara 
Another painting found in the rocks of the Sahara might have shown that the Sahara had at 
a point in time harbored aquatic animals. This has given the impression that the Sahara has 
always not being as dry as it is today. 
 
DEMERITS OF ARTS HISTORY 
i. Difficult to get 
Rock paintings which are peculiar to art forms are not common on the African continent 
especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This is due to the fact that painting was restricted 
to perishable surfaces such as textiles, wood, house walls among other therefore could not 
survive the high humid climatic conditions of the environment. 
ii. Depend on other sources 
The art historian encounters the problem of dating their artistic find. For that matter they 
resorts to the archeologist in dating things such pre-historic art. 
 
SEROLOGY AS A SOURCE OF AFRICAN HISTORY 
Serology is the branch of medicine concerned with the study of blood types. It deals with 
the blood serum components that protect the blood against diseases. 
ADVANTAGES OF SEROLOGY 
i. Human blood varies in composition from one person to another in the sense that some 
genes present in some people in some people are absent in others. For that matter people 
can be categorized according to their blood groups. It is therefore possible that adequate 
knowledge of a predominant blood type in another area or region should be able to 
establish some kind of hypothesis that the people of region A must have formed part of 
region B. 
ii. Belonging to a source 
Studies in the frequency of the sickle cell should be able to give the clue that, people belong 
to a particular source. A very good example of how the studies in the frequency in sickle cell 
can help historical research could be found in Windward Coast in Liberia. In this region, the 
Kru people are almost devoid of the sickle cell trait. Yet it is very common among the 
neighboring people. This confirms the fact that the Kru has been a close community who did 
not intermarry with their neighbors. 
 
METHODS USED IN GATHERING/COLLECTING INFORMATION FOR THE WRITING OF 
AFRICAN HISTORY 
To collect data for the reconstruction of African history, the historian must not rely solely on 
written sources or non-documentary sources but rather the following methods must be 
employed to check biases, prejudices and exaggerations. 
i. Personal enquiry and interview 
One method of gathering information from non-documentary sources of African history is 
interviewing of knowledgeable persons about the culture of a particular community. This is 
to say that the historian must interview people about the information of the past such as 
eye-witnesses or traditional historians like court linguists, older court officials and the 
elderly. The historian can record these interviews and later play, write out and analyze the 
information given. 
ii. Inter-disciplinary approach 
Another method of gathering information about African history is the interdisciplinary 
approach. Cooperation with scholars in other fields of knowledge gives information for 
African history. The historian has to cooperate with specialists like the linguists, 
archeologists, botanists, ethnographers among others to obtain materials that can be used 
to reconstruct African history. The researcher works together with these scholars to gather 
important information to draw valid conclusions. 
Reviewing 
In writing African history, one can use the review method to get information by reviewing 
the written sources such as books, newspapers, journals, broadcasts, diaries, manifestoes, 
and private letters among others, by reviewing the research through written sources both 
primary and secondary for information which they examine and cross-check. Even though 
these written records have shortcomings and inadequacies, they can be reviewed by the 
historian to ensure an accurate reflection of the past. This helps to produce unbiased history 
which is backed by evidence. 
Questionnaire 
To get the best results of collecting data for writing African history, a carefully composed 
questionnaire should be used which must cover the political, economic, social, religious and 
technological aspects. In this situation, a series of well-structured questions are given out to 
persons who know about the past to solicit for information. The responses to these 
questions are gathered and analyzed by the historian in order to draw a reasonable 
conclusion. 
Personal Observation and Records 
Through personal observation by visiting places of historical importance like slave sites, 
castles, forts etc. and personally recording events like festivals, funerals and the like, 
important findings can result in the collection of data for writing African history. Such details 
are necessary since they constitute first-hand information as the events happened before 
their own eyes i.e. eye witness account. Such accounts can be compared and questions are 
asked on them to get a reliable view of what actually happened in the past. 
Reliability of the sources for the study of African history 
Despite the fact that written and unwritten sources of African history have shortfalls, we 
can still describe them as adequately reliable, since the work of a historian is based on 
historical methods where they use scientific methods in drawing conclusions. Written 
records of history have a high level of precision and very reliable. All the documentary 
sources e.g. newspapers, personal letters, diaries, journals, manifestoes etc. can be 
reviewed and cross checked for a fair assessment of the past. This process helps to get rid of 
prejudices, biases to ensure truthfulness. By putting written records side by side with other 
forms of evidence, the historian can establish an objective conclusion. 
The reliability of unwritten sources of history cannot be underestimated since they all 
involve scientific methods in carrying out researches. For instance, the Ghanaian linguist, 
Professor Abena Dolphyne undertook a research on the Bono, Asante and Fante people and 
arrived at an important conclusion. She found out that the Asante language is less related to 
the Fante. Also, archeology which is our main source of information on African history uses 
scientific methods like reconnaissance, stratification, radiocarbon and potassium argon 
dating methods and data analysis. These methods help archeologists to come to accurate 
and reliable conclusions significant for historical writing. Reconnaissance involves the 
process of discovering sites and plotting them for digging. 
However, archeology as a non-documentary source of African history has some flaws. It is 
an unfortunate fact that there is no conscious system of preserving archeological 
knowledge. For that matter what archaeologists come across may be an accidental 
preservation. In this case, one goes into archeological excavation with the idea of acquiring 
some knowledge but relying on chance if not luck. Again, archaeological remains are 
subjected to wear and tear, weathering, and disfigurement and therefore are likely to 
present difficulty in the historians’ attempt to derive very reliable information from them. 
The process of radio-carbon dating is very expensive and that constitutes a hindrance to 
effective research. 
Moreover, oral tradition is full of exaggeration on establishment of information to suit the 
narrator’s interest. Many a time, they tend to present history in a way that would not only 
exclude portions that do not meet their interest but worse of all, it might not be able to give 
specific details due to genuine loss in memory. Again, oral tradition tends to put so much 
emphasis on personalities and events like wars, whilst playing down on social and economic 
aspects of the past With this, information becomes very scanty to the disadvantage of 
scholarship and posterity. 
In conclusion, we can deduce that both documentary and non-documentary evidence must 
be used to complement each other in the writing of African history. Since both are the work 
of human beings, one cannot be more reliable than the other since people tend to be 
subjective, biased and impressionistic.

2 - Trans-Saharan Trade. Origins, organization and effects in 
the development of West Africa 
 
Origins and Timeframe of Early Trade 
The connections of West Africa with the Mediterranean world is a very old one, which long 
predates the rise of Islam in the late 6th century CE. Several centuries before the rise of the 
Roman empire, the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484-425BCE) wrote of peoples in Africa. 
Herodotus wrote repeatedly of the peoples of the Nile Valley, stressing that many of them 
were Black Africans, and suggesting connections with people further to the west. Rock art 
from this period, and later, suggests the existence of wheeled chariots south of what is now 
the Sahara, and suggest a connection with the Mediterranean world.

It’s important to know that the Sahara desert itself was not as harsh in these ancient times 
as it later became, and is today. Rock art from the Sahara desert is abundant, and some of it 
is as much as 12000 years old. A good example is the Tassili n’Ajjer, north of Tamanrasset in 
the Algerian Sahara. This is one of the oldest examples of rock art in the Sahara. Another 
good example is in the Tibesti Massif in Chad, which also has rock art dating from around 
this time. These old paintings show areas which are now in the desert as fertile, rich with 
animals which can no longer live in these desert areas, such as buffalos, elephants, 
rhinoceros, and hippopotamus. It’s important to bear in mind that this era of fertility in the 
Sahara coincided with the European Ice Age. The Ice Age was not a problem in Africa, and in 
fact this seems to have been a time of plenty. 
The Sahara appears to have begun desertifying more rapidly around 3000 years BCE, but 
there remained strong connections with the Mediterranean until a later point. This is shown 
by the Carthaginian general, Hannibal. Carthage was an empire based in Libya [the most 
powerful empire in the Mediterranean until the rise of Rome], and around 220 BCE Hannibal 
embarked on an attack on Roman forces in Europe which involved crossing the high Alps 
mountain range. His military supplies were carried by elephants, and these were African 
elephants connected to the peoples and geographies south of the Sahara. 
Desertification increased and the geographical boundaries became harder to cross. By the 
time of the rise of Islam, in the early 7th century CE [from c. 610fl., with the establishment of 
the early Caliphs, c. 610 CE], there were fewer connections. But the growth of powerful 
Islamic kingdoms in Morocco, and of centres of learning based in Cairo, Tripoli, and the 
Middle East, saw the rise of the caravan trade. By the 9th century CE, the empire of Ghāna 
[also known as Awkar] had been founded in what is now Mauritania [the first historical 
references coming from c. 830 CE], with the capital at Koumbi-Saleh [the trading route from 
Ghāna was concentrated in the Western Sahara, with its terminus at Sījīlmassa]. By the 10th 
century CE there were separate settlements for those practicing African religions and those 
practising Islam at Koumbi-Saleh, indicating the large number of North African traders who 
were coming. The gold trade was already spreading to influence commerce and society in 
the Mediterranean, and it was at around 1000 CE that West African gold was first minted for 
markets in Europe. 
It’s important to grasp how events in West Africa were connected to those in North Africa 
and even in Europe by the 11th century. A vital change occurred in this time, spearheaded by 
the Almoravid movement. They appear to have grown from Berber Muslims who migrated 
north from the Senegal river seeking a purer form of Islam after the middle of the 11th 
century. They conquered the Kingdom of Morocco, founded Marrakech in 1062, and then 
swept into Al-Andalus in southern Spain in the 1080s, where they defended the Caliphate of 
Córdoba from the reconquest led by the Christian kings of Spain. Córdoba had already 
splintered into many different mini states in southern Spain known as the Taifa states in the 
1030s; in the 12th century these were overtaken by the Almohads, who also came from 
Morocco, overthrowing the Almoravids in 1147. 
In West Africa, the most important changes came in Ghāna. Until 1076, Muslims and 
worshippers of African religions had co-existed there, but in that year the Almoravids sacked 
the city and Ghāna fell into decline. Mali would not rise until the 13th century. Thereafter, 
the gold trade was the centrepiece of the trans-Saharan trade. Money was the cause of the 
early interest of Arabic traders in West Africa, which was indeed known to them as “the 
golden country”.The influence of the trans-Saharan gold trade on European societies can be 
seen for instance in the derivation of the Spanish word for gold coin in the 15th century, 
maravedí, from the Almoravid murabitūn dinar. 
The trade in gold saw the rise of powerful empires such as Mali, Bono-Mansu, and Songhay, 
the expansion of urban centres such as Kano, and the rise of powerful trading classes such 
as the Wangara. Arabic became increasingly influential through the spread of Islam and its 
use as a script for administration. By the 15th century, when the Atlantic trade would begin, 
the trans-Saharan trade had been flourishing for at least 5 centuries, and had already 
shaped the rise, fall, and consolidation of many West African states and societies. 
Key Factors of Trade: Environment, Gold, Horses, and the Organization of the Caravan 
Trade 
One of the major elements in the creation of trade networks is geography. Trade tends to 
be in products which cannot be found in one area, and which are exchanged with those 
which are needed in another. For example, societies living in areas with forest products can 
exchange them for salt from desert areas, and grain crops from savannah areas.In turn, 
savannah and desert peoples can acquire forest products. Thus, a vital factor in the 
emergence of the social fabric of West Africa was the Sahara desert. 
Where the geographical barriers between different climate zones are extensive, the trade 
networks needed to move goods have to be more complicated. In order to thrive, societies 
need to develop new means of accommodating stranger traders. Where the barrier is as 
large as the Sahara desert, or the Atlantic Ocean, the social fabric will become intertwined 
with these complex trading networks. This occurred in West Africa with the trans-Saharan 
trade; and the social frameworks which emerged with this trade then became influential in 
shaping the early trans-Atlantic trade. So it is hard to understand the importance of trans-
Saharan trade without understanding its importance for society, in terms of organisation 
and belief. 
One important climatic factor in the shaping of West African societies was the spread of the 
tsetse fly. In humid forest zones, the tsetse fly which causes Sleeping Sickness meant that it 
was hard for pack animals to survive. Camels, horses, donkeys, and the like could not easily 
survive in areas where the tsetse fly could live and thrive. This meant that society had to be 
organised so that people would fulfill that role, and be able to carry headloads of gold, kola 
nuts, ivory, and more. This became significant as the trans-Saharan gold trade became ever 
more important from the 11th century onwards. 
There were two main zones for the location of gold in West Africa. One was on the Upper 
Senegal river, especially the tributary of the Falémé. The other was in the forests of the Gold 
Coast. Being close to the source of gold was of course a great political prize, and it is 
significant that the areas near to both the Falémé and the forests of the Gold Coast saw the 
rise of stable political systems for many centuries. In the Falémé, this was the kingdom of 
Gajaaga [known by the French as Galam], which saw stable rule for 8 centuries [according to 
the Senegalese historian Abdoulaye Bathily]. In the Gold Coast, this came in a series of 
powerful Akan states, beginning with Bono-Mansu in the 14th century, and then continuing 
through Denkyira and Akwamu to 1700, all of whom relied on the gold trade. 
In Senegambia, the Falémé source of gold was in a semi-desert area where the tsetse fly 
could not thrive [later this was close to the heartland of the kingdom of Bundu]. This 
favoured the creation of powerful cavalry forces, and so one of the main things traded by 
the North African traders in the trans-Saharan trade were their famous “Arab” horses. 
Cavalries were important to the process of state formation and military control in areas such 
as the Jolof empire in northern Senegambia, and in Borno and Kano further to the east. 
Indeed, one of the first areas of the trans-Saharan trade which Europeans copied was in the 
institution of a horse trade, with horses bred on the Capeverdean islands and traded to the 
West African coast as early as the 1470s. 
In Bono-Mansu, however, horses could not flourish because of the tsetse fly. This meant 
that the role of head-carriers was vital in ensuring the smooth operation of the gold trade. 
Gold was dug out of the mines in the forests a hundred miles north of the Atlantic coast, 
and then porteraged north to the termini of the trans-Saharan trade at Oualata [in present-
day Mauritania], Timbuktu [in present-day Mali], Kano, and N’gazarzamu at Borno. 
These urban centres were vital to the organization of the trans-Saharan trade as a whole. 
They had to develop complex infrastructure of service provision for the long-distance 
traders.By the 15th century, each of these cities had hotels for horses and traders, clearing 
houses for animals to return for the long-distance trade back to the Mediterranean, and 
markets where the wherewithal for the trade could be bought: saddlery and other kit for 
camels and horses, huge stocks of grain (millet, rice, and cous) to feed the slaves and traders 
crossing the Sahara, skins for water, dried meat, and more. Some, such as Timbuktu, had 
also become centres of learning for the scholars who accompanied the caravans; for Islam 
was also becoming ever more closely related to the success and transformation of the trans-
Saharan trade. 
Traders and Diasporas 
The traders who specialised in linking up the different centres of the trans-Saharan trade 
were known as the Wangara. By the 15th century, the Wangara formed an important trade 
diaspora, stretching from The Gambia in the West to Borno in the East; they also had 
connections in the Mali empire, and as far south as Bono-Mansu, and some of the Akan 
states on the southern Atlantic coast of what is now Ghana. 
As we have seen, Islam had become closely connected to trans-Saharan trade: all of the 
traders from North Africa who came with the caravans were Muslims, and they preferred to 
trade with Muslims only. The rise of the Almoravid movement in the 11th century, and the 
fall of Ghāna, made it clear that those rulers who converted to Islam would fare better in 
the trans-Saharan stakes. 
At the same time, Islam remained the religion of the nobles and the trader class. It was not 
the faith of everyone, and some would resist it strongly. Thus West African rulers who 
wanted to succeed in the trans-Saharan trade had to develop a complex strategy. On the 
one hand, they had to be seen as Muslims in order to be able to entice the trans-Saharan 
traders: and yet at the same time, they had to be able to relate to their subjects, many of 
whom were not Muslims. 
This commercial reality contributed to what historians call “plural societies”. A plural society 
can be defined as one in which more than one religion is allowed and tolerated where 
people can mix across ethnic and religious lines, and where the ability to respect more than 
one faith is an important part of political and social life. This can be seen through the oral 
accounts of key rulers such as Sunjata Keita of Mali, many of which emphasise the place of 
musicians in the court of Mali. The balafon was a royal instrument, which can be seen 
through its relationship in oral accounts to the sorcerer-king whom Sunjata defeated, 
Sumanguru Kante. Sumanguru was also reputed as a “Blacksmith king”, in tune with the 
supernatural powers of smiths and previous political regimes. Thus even Islamic rulers such 
as those of Mali showed their respect of African religions [and this may also explain why 
political leaders from Mali explained in Cairo in the 1320s that it was not possible to convert 
the producers of gold to Islam]. 
The Wangara diaspora of traders gradually became more and more important in creating a 
common culture across different parts of West Africa. Their arrival in Borno by the 15th 
century showed how the pluralism of society, the spread of Islam as a scholarly, religious, 
and commercial religion, and the arrival of more and more global influences were all coming 
together across a wide part of West Africa. 
Arabic, Literacy, and Scholarly Production 
One of the impacts of the growing trans-Saharan trade was the spread of Arabic as a written 
language in West Africa. Arabic became not only a language of faith and religious 
scholarship, with the many mallams, shereefs, and other seers who came to the region. It 
was also a language of government and law. The many manuscripts now housed in the 
Ahmed Baba Institute in Timbuktu are testament to the spread of literacy in West Africa 
from an early time, and certainly it had become important by the 13th century. 
Rulers of important West African empires such as Mali and Songhay of course maintained 
existing indigenous frameworks of rulership. However they borrowed Islamic bureaucratic 
forms, religion, scholarship and legal structures to govern the new states, and the complex 
international relationships which they were developing through trade with the rest of the 
Islamic world. Taxation, law, and state offices all developed alongside the literate class 
which became vital to the functioning of the states of the Sahel. 
By the 15th and 16th centuries, certain desert clans were renowned for their learning and 
scholarship. In Western areas such as Mauritania, these were known as the zwāya, and in 
the later 17th century they would have a major role in the Islamic revival movement which 
spread in the 18th century.Desert clans such as the Masūfa also migrated to Timbuktu from 
Māsina in central Mali, bringing special areas of learning in Islamic law (fiqh).The high status 
of these scholars is shown by the fact that the great Timbuktu scholar Ahmad Baba had as 
his main shaykh or religious instructor a scholar from Djenné on the Niger. [Ahmed Baba 
lived from 1556 to 1627, and wrote over 40 books in his lifetime; he has the reputation of 
being Timbuktu’s greatest scholar].

The spread of Arabic has been studied by some historians through the spread of the use of 
Arabic on tombstones. The Brazilian historian PF de Moraes Farias spent his career studying 
these funerary inscriptions in cemeteries in Mauritania, Mali, and Niger. What he found was 
a more integrated history of Songhay, Tamasheq, Berber and Mande peoples than 
traditional histories had suggested. Arabic was not only an elite language of learning, but 
also became a language used by many to pay homage to their departed family members.

History, United States. Wikipedia. Public domain. 
An important feature of this rise of Arabic was the spread of scholars from North Africa in 
centres of learning such as Kano and Timbuktu. Indeed, this was also an exchange, since 
scholars from West African cities moved to learn, study, and preach further afield. One was 
Al-Kānemī, from Kanem-Borno, who lived and taught in Marrakesh c. 1200, before dying in 
Andalusía in Spain. By the 14th century, annual caravans took pilgrims from West Africa to 
North Africa and then to Mecca, and there was in Cairo a hostel to accommodate only those 
pilgrims who came from Borno; while Askia Mohammed, who became ruler of Songhay c. 
1495, instituted a garden and lodge for pilgrims from West Africa in Medina [a holy city of 
Islam, in Arabia], during his own hajj.

The frequency of such presences of West Africans in the wider Islamic world is shown not 
only through the spread of Arabic, and the number of documented journeys made, but also 
by oral accounts. For instance, [the Gambian theologian Lamin Sanneh notes that] one of 
the most important strains of Islam in this period was that of Suwerian Islam. The founder of 
Suwerian Islam, al-Hajj Sālim Suware, is said in oral accounts to have made the pilgrimage to 
Mecca seven times in the early 13th century. This is unlikely to be true, given just how 
difficult this journey was [and also as the Qur’an lonely requires it as a duty for Muslims to 
make the pilgrimage once in their lifetimes if possible]. However, the story reveals just how 
normal these journeys were, and how often they took place. 
By the 15th century, the growth of the gold trade had gone hand in hand with the emphasis 
on scholarship. The last 15th century Sarki of Kano, Mohammed Rimfa, invited large 
numbers of scholars to settle in the city, and one of them – Sherif Abdu Rahman – came 
from Medina. Rahman brought his own library and many learned followers. The city walls of 
Kano were built, and the Kurmi market established, which showed just how much urban 
developments, learning, and the growth of the trans-Saharan trade had become 
interconnected. 
This was also very apparent in Timbuktu. Timbuktu grew a reputation as a city of learning, 
and yet during the reign of Sonni Ali (c. 1464-93) of Songhay, its scholars felt undermined 
and slighted. After Sonni Ali’s death, many mallams from Timbuktu complained at his 
rulership and departure from orthodox Islam, and the ways in which they claimed he had 
persecuted the mallams. In the 16th century, a succession of Askias ruled who followed a 
more orthodox path of Islam, and the city’s reputation as a centre of learning reached its 
peak. But this would fall with the Moroccan invasion of Songhay in 1591 [after which time, 
many of its scholars would disperse west, to Mauritania; which is why many scholars of 
Islam in Mauritania see this as the centre of Islamic scholarship in the Sahel by the 18th and 
19th centuries]. 
Mali and Mansa Musa 
Perhaps the most famous and influential kingdom linked to the trans-Saharan trade was 
that of Mali. Mali was founded by Sunjata Keita in the 13th century, defeating the blacksmith 
king Sumanguru Kante. However, in Mali, the ruler who reached world renown at the time 
was the Emperor Mansa Musa. 
Abraham Cresques, Catalan Atlas, Detail showing Mansa Musa sitting on a throne and 
holding a gold coin, 1375, Wikicommons. 
Mansa Kankan Musa Keita was the son of Mansa Aboubacarr II the Navigator who in the 
1300s sent out an expedition across the Atlantic Ocean from River Gambia to discover new 
territories. His son Mansa Kankan Musa Keita better known as Mansa Musa ruled Mali from 
1312-1337. His reign lasted barely quarter of century but the whole 1300s are still called 
the Century of Mansa Musa because of his lasting legacy. 
This legacy came out more for his exploits on his way to Mecca to perform his pilgrimage 
1324-1325 than in any wars he fought and won or lost. He apparently did not want to 
perform the pilgrimage as he was still a nominal Muslim but when he accidentally killed his 
mother, he decided to perform the Hajj to purify himself and atone for his capital crime. He 
took along the entire court of his to Mecca including doctors, princes, griots and an army of 
body guard which numbered 8000 men! He left he Capital of Mali and traversed the Sahara 
through Walata in present day Mauretania, then Libya before entering Cairo. From Cairo he 
entered the Holy city of Mecca. 
This pilgrimage had economic, political and religious consequences. 
Economically, Mansa Musa dispensed so much gold on his way to Mecca that he has since 
then been called the richest ever human being to live on this earth. He also cemented trade 
ties between Mali and the Middle East and Cairo such that from 1325, caravans of over 
10,000 camels traversed the Sahara into Mali at Gao and Timbuktu. Religiously, Mansa 
Musa and his huge entourage returned from the hajj renewed Muslims who now wanted to 
strengthen the religion and spread it far and wide. The Malian masses which were mostly 
animist then, were soon converted by the fresh pilgrims. Also, Mali opened up to more Arab 
scholars who were attracted by the immense wealth Mansa Musa displayed. These Arabs 
built fabulous mosques and courts for Mansa Musa. He also brought along great scholars 
who helped him establish the famous libraries in Gao, Jenne and Timbuktu. The hajj became 
one of the world’s greatest PR exercises! Politically, Mali became well known and Mansa 
Musa earned international repute. His pilgrimage put Mali firmly on the map. Indeed, 
before his death in 1337, Mansa Musa has expanded Mali into a sprawling empire with over 
400 cities extending from the Atlantic in the West to the forest zones of the south. All the 
known states of the time such as Songhay,, Ghana, Galam, Tekrur formed part of Mansa 
Musa’s Mali. Mansa Musa indeed gave Mali her glory and Mali also gave Mansa Musa his 
glory! 
 
Political reorganization in the 15th century: Bono-Mansu, Mossi, Kano, and Songhay 
The growth of the trans-Saharan trade from the 10th to the 15th century led to profound 
transformations across West Africa, and this can be seen through a whole range of 
transformations that took place in the 15th century, from West to East and from North to 
South. It would be political, economic and social transformations in West Africa that would 
drive globalization and Europe’s role in this, not the other way around. 
A good example are events in Nigeria. In Borno, the growth of the gold trade from Bono-
Mansu would lead to the movement of the capital away from the old centre of Kanem, 
further south to Gazargamo (Ngazargamu) in Borno circa 1470. In Kano, there was the 
establishment of a new system, the Sarauta system. Meanwhile, the 10-metre deep 
earthworks known as “Eredos”, built around Ijebu in Yorubaland, have recently been dated 
[by the archaeologist Gérard Chouin] to the period 1370-1420. 
In other regions similar transformations were afoot. In Mali, the Dogon people of the 
Bandiagara escarpment probably moved there in the 15th century. At the same time, in the 
15th century, the Mossi kingdom rose in what is now Burkina Faso, linked to the profits to be 
made from taxing the onward gold trade.Al-Sa’dī describes Mossi attacking the town of 
Mâssina in this period.It was also at this time that Bono-Mansurose to prominence. 
Meanwhile, the key gold-trading centre of Bighu, also on the Gold Coast and which was to 
become very important in the 17th and 18th century, is mentioned by al-Ouazzan (as Bito) in 
the 1520s, suggesting that it too rose to prominence in these decades. 
Meanwhile, in Senegambia, the rise of the major military leader Koli Tenguela at the end of 
the 15th century coincided probably with an attempt to control the gold trade which came 
from the kingdom of Wuuli, on the north bank of the Gambia river. Tenguela, a Fula, would 
eventually lead an army south across the Gambia river to the Fuuta Jaalo mountains in 
Guinea-Conakry and establish a new polity there. This would lead in turn to the 
establishment of Fuuta Tooro on the Senegal river. 
In other words, all across West Africa, from Borno to Fuuta Tooro, political transformations 
were taking place well before trade with Europe had begun. West African mining 
technology, economic transformation, and political reorganization grew. This helped to 
create the framework in which European powers sought to expand their knowledge of the 
world, as they began to sail along the West African coast in the 15th century. 
The most remarkable example came in northern Nigeria. Kano grew very rapidly in the 15th 
century, sending out military expeditions to the south and becoming a regional hub linking 
trading networks from southern Nigeria to what is now Mali and beyond. [The Kano 
Chronicle gives some details of these changes]. In the reign of Kano’s Sarkin Dauda (c. 1421-
38), we are told of the connections between Kano and the province of Nupe. The major 
power between Kano and Nupe was Zaria, which conquered a large area of land. The Kano 
Chronicle says, “at this time, Zaria, under Queen Amina, conquered all the towns as far as 
Kwararafa and Nupe. Every town paid tribute to her. The Sarkin Nupe sent forty eunuchs 
and ten thousand kolas to her…in time the whole of the products of the west were brought 
to Hausaland [of which Kano was the capital]”. 
Just as European power was beginning to expand along the West African coast in the 15th 
century, therefore, so the impact of the trans-Saharan trade reached its zenith. The 15th 
century was not just the time of European expansion, but of global expansion of networks, 
trade, productions, and the manifestation of this power in more complex states, in West 
Africa and beyond. 
Koli Tengella and Tekrur 
Tekrur was another of the states which thrived largely as a result of the Trans-Saharan 
trade. It was founded in the 7th century, and was located in present day North-East Senegal 
in the valley of the Senegal River. For many years, Tekrur laid quietly as a vassal of the 
Ghana and Mali empires. Tekrur had largely Serahuly and Mande speaking populations, but 
in the 15th century, the Fula became powerful and removed the ruling Mande class and 
established the Janonkobe dynasty. They were led by a warrior the Senegalese historian 
Ousman Ba called ‘the great hero and saviour of the Peulh’ named Koli, the son of Tengella. 
He formed and mobilised a vast army and ravaged through Fouta Jallon, Mali and Jollof to 
make Tekrur the unvanquished power in the region. Koli was crowned as Satigi or emperor 
over the vast lands now under the control of his Fula armies. His capital was at Gode, near 
the present day Matam. 
Koli is remembered in the Fouta Toro legends as the big chief of the Fula animist aristocracy 
who lived on war and slavery, catching especially of the Fula and Tukulor Muslims of his 
empire. No doubt then in 1776, the Muslims headed by Sulayman Bal revolted against Koli’s 
oppression to found the Muslim state of Fouta. How did Koli benefit from the trade across 
the Sahara? Simply put, by trading grain in exchange for firearms. He was able to build a 
strong army which maintained Tekrur’s dominance for many decades. It is clear from what 
has been said above that the trade across the Sahara helped to build strong states and also 
to destroy them as weapons became readily available and the lucrative trade also generated 
envy and the desire to dominate. 
Ghana and Songhai Empires 
Ghana was one of the most famous and earliest of the West African empires. It existed 
between the 5th and 13th centuries in the modern Mali and Mauritania, and was heavily 
connected to the trans-Saharan trade. The Ghana empire with its capital of Kumbi Saleh in 
Mauritainia, is not to be confused with modern Ghana with its capital at Accra, which was 
named after it. The principal inhabitants of Ghana were the Serahuli, also called Soninke, 
who were part of the Mande-speaking people. 
Ghana owed her progress and prosperity and influence to the strategic role it played in the 
Trans-Saharan trade. British historian Kevin Shillington was categorical in this: ‘...Ghana’s 
position with regard to the trade.... made it grow powerful and its rulers became rich.... It 
seems likely that trade was a major factor in the growth of Ghana from the very beginning’. 
Ghana was located half way between the sources of the two Trans-Saharan trade items: salt 
from the desert up north and gold from Bambuk to the East. Ghana played the enviable role 
of middleman. The introduction of the camel as carrier of goods in the trade was a massive 
boost to the exchange between Ghana and the desert peoples such as the Berbers. 
Ghana’s glory could not be hidden simply because it was well traced and chronicled by the 
Arabic traders who came there. As early as the 11th century an Arab geographer called al-
Bakari visited Kumbi Saleh, the capital and described the fabulous wealth he saw and the 
well advanced form of administration run by the Ghana ruler. He observed that Kumbi Saleh 
had two separate wards: the foreigners’ quarter where Arab trader resided and the main 
ward where the king and his people lived. The dumbstruck Arab visitor also described in 
glowing terms how well dressed in gold the Ghana king was, how he was able to raise an 
army of 200,000 men and how he allowed both Islam and animism to be practised in Kumbi 
Saleh. Of course, our Arab writers only met the royals, nobles and traders as they were 
interested only in gold. They said little about what the ordinary people did for a living; but 
we can glean from the writings that they fished and farmed along the banks of the River 
Senegal to survive. 
Ghana’s glory rested on trade and so did its collapse. When the Almoravids started to wage 
war against other Berber tribes, the trade routes to Ghana became unsafe and trade was 
affected. Dry weather conditions also affected Ghana’s ability to feed herself and her vast 
army; this seriously weakened the state. Also, by the 12th century, vassals like Mali had 
began to rebel to gain freedom from Ghana’s dominance. 
Songhay, on the other hand lasted from the 11th to 16th century. It rose to prominence as a 
result of the Trans-Saharan trade. As early as the 14th century Muslim traders were settled 
in Gao, the principal trade town of Songhay. Gao became the hub for the Trans-Saharan 
trade for the central and eastern Sahara. The farmers and fishermen of Songay ensured the 
traders were well fed. 
Songhay collected the bulk of her revenue from the taxes levied on trade caravans. One of 
the great Songhay emperors was Muhamed Ture also called Askia Muhamed who 
introduced Islam in to Songhay and increased the empire’s reaches. Like Mansa Musa of 
Mali, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca where he showed how rich and powerful his kingdom 
was. The Trans-Saharan trade helped to make Songhai rich and prosperous. 
Conclusion 
It should be noted that the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important into the 19th and 
even the 20th century, as the continuing trade and human traffic shows. The desert is a 
geographical barrier which requires complex organisation to cross – those who crossed it 
laid the foundations of some of the most important states in West African history.

3 - Islam in West Africa. Introduction, spread and effects 
 
Africa was the first continent, that Islam spread into out of Arabia in the early seventh 
century. Almost one-third of the world’s Muslim population resides today in the continent. 
It was estimated in 2002 that Muslims constitute 45% of the population of Africa. Islam has 
a large presence in North Africa, West Africa, the horn of Africa, the Southeast and among 
the minority but significant immigrant population in South Africa. 
The first West Africans to be converted were the inhabitants of the Sahara, the Berbers, and 
it is generally agreed that by the second half of the tenth century, the Sahara had become 
Dar al-Islam that is the country of Islam. 
In this chapter, we shall look at the spread of Islam in West Africa as well as the effects of 
Islam. We shall also find out the activities of the Almoravids. 
The Spread of Islam in West Africa 
After the Berbers’ Islamisation, the religion spread into the Western Sudan from the closing 
decades of the tenth century. First, Islam spread into the regions West of the Niger Bend 
(Senegambia, Mali), then into Chad region and finally into Hausaland. 
According to some Arabic sources the first Black ruler to embrace Islam was the King of Gao 
who had done so by 1009. The first King of Mali to become a Muslim was Barmandana, who 
was reigning by the middle of the eleventh century. The Kings of Ghana, on the other hand 
did not embrace Islam until about the beginning of the twelfth century, after the Almoravid 
invasions. 
In the Chad region, it appears from the Arabic sources that Umme Jilmi, who became the 
king of Kanem in 1086 was the first Muslim King. Islam was first introduced into Hausaland 
from either Kanem or Air in the twelfth or thirteenth centuries, but it did not really take root 
there until during the second half of the fourteenth Century. 
Reason for the spread of Islam in West Africa 
The following are the reasons for the spread Islam in West Africa. By the end of the fifteenth 
century, Islam had spread southwards to the fringes of the forest belt. 
i. The Nature of Islam 
The nature of Islam as a religion accepting polygamy to some extent, its tolerance of 
traditional African religions, its simplicity of doctrine and mode of worship helped 
propagators to make converts in Africa. These factors also made Islam easily adaptable to 
the African communities with which it came in contact. Again, the Islamisation of Africa was 
paralleled by the Africanisation of Islam. The making and sale of charms and amulets, which 
were believed to offer protection against evil forces and generally ensure success in life, 
were important in winning over converts. 
ii. Trade 
Another major reason that led to the rapid spread of Islam in West Africa was the trans-
Saharan trade network. From the seventh century onwards, Muslim traders from the 
Maghreb and the Sahara started settling first in some of the market centres in the Sahel and 
then in the Savanna areas. Al-Bakri, a renowned Arabic Scholar and merchant wrote in 1067, 
that the capital of ancient Ghana was already divided into two parts; about six miles apart, 
the Muslim traders’ part which had as many as twelve mosques and the King’s part had one 
mosque for the use of the king’s Muslim visitors. It was these resident Muslim traders who 
converted the rulers and the principal local town’s people to Islam. Also, according to Kano 
Chronicles, during the reign of Yaji, the King of Kano from 1349 to 1385, the Wangarawa 
came from Melle bringing the Mohammedan religion. These examples grew the process of 
Islamisation or conversion to Islam, as it gathered momentum. 
iii. Activities of Muslim Clerics 
Islam also spread into West Africa through the activities of Muslim clerics, marabouts and 
scholars or mallams. These clerics or learned men founded their own religious centres which 
attracted students from all parts of the Western Sudan and who on the completion of their 
studies and training went back to their own homes to win converts. Many of them went on 
lecture or missionary tours to convert people, while others became advisers to Sudanese 
Kings on how to become effective rulers. Some clerics devoted a great deal of their time to 
writing books and instructions on all aspects of Islam for the education and conversion of 
people or the purification and strengthening of Islam. Some examples of clerics follow: 
Ibu Khadija al-Kumi, a Muslim missionary and Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, a poet, scholar and 
architect from Granada were both invited by Mansa Musa to accompany him on his return 
from his celebrated pilgrimage in 1324/5. Both of them settled in Mali where they taught 
Islam. Al-Sahili also designed the great mosque of Timbuktu as well as a magnificent palace 
for Mansa Musa in the capital of Mali. 
Again, the great Mande scholar, Abd Rahman Zaite (now identified as Abd al-Rahman 
Jakhite) settled in Kano on the invitation of Rumfa, the King of Kano. He built a mosque and 
introduced the practice of Koran recital and other devotional exercises. 
Another brilliant Berber scholar called Abd al-Rahman al-Maghili (1477-78) established his 
Zawiyaie Islamic school in Tuat in the Sahara, and from there went on a missionary tour of 
the Western Sudan which lasted from 1492 to 1503. During this tour, he visited Air, 
Takedda, Kano, Katsina and Gao and preached to both rulers and commoners. 
iv. Activities of Rulers 
Islam gained ground in West Africa through the activities of the individual rulers. The rulers 
of the Western Sudan encouraged the trans-Saharan trade and extended hospitality to both 
traders and visiting clerics, but perhaps one of the most important ways in which they 
encouraged acceptance of Islam was through their own conversion. With a Muslim King or 
ruler it rapidly became a matter of prestige among the aristocracy also to convert to Islam in 
many kingdoms. Many rulers made considerable efforts to encourage Muslim institutions 
such as Islamic tax and legal systems or the provision of facilities such as mosques, through 
the appointment of Muslim officials such as judges and butchers who observe the Islamic 
code and to lead prayers, celebrating Muslim festival and ordering every town under their 
control to observe the ritual prayers. The pilgrimages that many of the rulers undertook – 
such as Mansa Musa and Askia Mohammed -- had a considerable spiritual effect increasing 
their determination both to strengthen and purify Islam and to spread it even further. 
v. Holy War 
What is more, another way in which Islam was introduced and spread in West Africa in 
general and the Western Sudan in particular was the militant jihad, or the waging of holy 
war against infidels or lukewarm Muslims. This method allowed the third and final stage of 
the process of Islamisation to reach its climax with the nineteenth-century jihad in the 
Western Sudan, between Mali and Senegambia and Hausaland in northern Nigeria. 
The first jihad in the Western Sudan which has accounts was that waged by the head of the 
Sudanese confederation. It was Tarsina against the Sudanese people in 1023, soon after his 
return from the pilgrimage to Mecca. He was killed during these clashes. The second is that 
of the King of Takrur, War-Ajabbi, before his death in 1040. The third and the best known of 
these early jihads was the one declared by the Almoravid movement of ancient Ghana 
between 1048 and 1054 by the scholar, Abdallah Ibn Yasin. Between 1056 and 1070s, the 
Almoravid conquered the whole area between ancient Ghana and Sijilmasa. By 1087 the 
Almoravid Empire stretched from the Senegal in the south across the Mediterranean to 
Spain in the north. 
vi. Inter-marriage 
Islam also spread on to West Africa through inter-marriages. The Muslim merchants from 
North Africa came down settled and married the African women who became Muslims 
including their children. 
vii. Scholars 
The early Muslim missionaries opened Islamic schools and colleges. The products of these 
schools and colleges also did well by spreading the religion. They worked with the rulers as 
advisors, councilors etc. for instance, Ibn Yasin established a Zaniyaor college and founded 
the Almoravid movement which contributed considerably to the spread of Islam in the 
Sahara and Western Sudan. Also one of the greatest clerics and missionaries of the Western 
Sudan was al-Hajj Suware, the Soninke scholar founded the important Zawiga at Diakha – 
Bambuk which attracted students from all over the Western Sudan during the first half of 
the thirteenth century. Scholarship was indeed also attractive to rulers in West Africa, 
because the widespread use of the Arabic script made administering their kingdoms easier, 
and tax revenues easier to accrue. Thus, Timbuktu became known for its famous 
Djingnereber Mosque and prestigious Sankore University, both of which were established in 
the early 1300s under the reign of the Mali Empire, most famous ruler Mansa Musa. 
 
THE EFFECTS OF ISLAM IN WEST AFRICA 
Islam had a great impact on the people and states of Western Sudan and for that matter 
West Africa in general. Unlike Christianity, Islam is not a just a religion or a mass of doctrines 
or beliefs and rituals, but rather a complete way of life or civilization. The following are the 
effects of Islam in West Africa. 
POLITICAL EFFECTS 
i. Unity 
Islam cut across family, clan and ethnic ties and loyalties and emphasized unity and 
brotherhood. It enabled rulers to build larger Kingdoms and empires embracing different 
peoples and Linguistic groups. It also provided them with a commonly accepted basis of 
authority in place of African traditional religious which differed from place to place. Many of 
the rulers of Western Sudan, such as Mansa Musa of Mali, Askia Mohammed of Songhai and 
Idris Alooma of Borno did attempt to use Islam in these ways to generate a feeling of unity 
and as a basis of their authority. 
ii. System of Administration 
Most of the Muslim rulers of Western Sudan adopted the Muslim systems of justice and 
taxation. Thus, Islam promoted a more efficient administration in some of the states of 
Western Sudan since it enabled the rulers to employ educated Muslims as secretaries, 
administrators, judges and diplomats and also to correspond with provincial rulers and 
administrators. It is significant that even non-Muslim rulers such as those of ancient Ghana 
before the eleventh century employed some Muslims in their administration. Furthermore, 
the holy wars which some rulers waged helped to extend the frontiers of their states. 
iii. Establishment of Diplomatic Relations 
The rulers of Western Sudan established strong diplomatic relations with other Muslim 
rulers abroad as Mansa Musa and Idris Alooma did with those of Egypt and Tunis 
respectively. Other diplomatic connections were with the Ottoman Empire, and Al-Andalus 
in southern Spain. 
iv. Army 
The hajj brought pilgrims into contact with technology and scholarship at the centre of the 
Muslim world, which were often adopted and introduced when the pilgrims returned home. 
For instance, Idris Alooma of Borno brought back from his pilgrimage musketeers and 
Turkish military instructors, and created musketeers corps in his army which enabled him to 
extend the frontiers of his state relatively with ease. 
RELIGIOUS EFFECTS 
v. Pilgrimage to Mecca. 
The pilgrimage or hajj which Muslims were expected to undertake if they were able to do 
so, contributed in many ways to the growth and strength of some of the states. The hajj 
enabled the pilgrims to acquire first the highly coveted title of Al-Hajj and more importantly, 
the Barka, that is, the spiritual power which a pilgrim acquired by touching the black stone 
of the Ka’ba or Great Temple in Mecca and visiting the tomb of the Prophet at Medina. This 
power was of great importance, especially for the rulers, since it greatly increased their 
reputation and religious standing among their subjects. 
Indeed, it is because of the acquisition of this power that the hajj was and is still so popular 
among Muslims, especially, Muslim rulers. 
vi. The Pillar of Islam 
There was the replacement of the worship of false gods in some areas. Converts seriously 
observed the five pillars of Islam, namely; daily prayers including the Friday congregational 
prayer, fasting, compulsory alms-giving and pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj). 
 
SOCIAL EFFECTS 
vii. Literacy 
Islam introduced literacy as well as Muslim education into West Africa. Literacy made it 
possible for scholars to preserve the history and the oral traditions of some of the states in 
books. Examples of such books are the Tarikh es Sudan written by Al-Sa’di in Timbuktu in 
the seventeenth century. Literacy also enabled people in the Western Sudan to join access 
to the invaluable Islamic literature, sciences and philosophy which broadened their 
knowledge, improved their statecraft and widened their horizon. 
viii. Establishment of Schools 
As Islam continued to spread in West Africa, schools and educational centres were 
established in large towns and cities in Western Sudan. Such towns include Jenne, Timbuctu, 
Gao Kano and Katsina, and were as much creations of the Islamisation of the Western Sudan 
as they were of the trans-Saharan trade. 
ix. Great Scholars 
Islam produced great scholars in Western Sudanese states and West Africa as a whole. 
Among them are; Mahamud Kati(1468-1593) a Soninke scholar who wrote the Tarikh al 
Fettash (The Chronicle of the Seeker). The second was Abdurrahman-as Sadi a government 
secretary and diplomat who wrote the Tarikh al Sudan (The Chronicle of Sudan). The third 
was Ahmed Baba, the author of fifty works on law and a biographical dictionary. Thirteen of 
his writings are known. He was also the owner of an important library.

nationale de France, Département des manuscrits, Arabe 5256, 
http://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc20347c 
x. Change in Culture 
There was also the change in cultural life as a result of the introduction of Islam in West 
Africa. In all the states of Western Sudan-Muslim wives of prominent men were required to 
live in purdah (seclusion) and to veil their faces when they went out. 
 
ECONOMIC EFFECTS 
xi. Architecture 
Islam helped in the introduction of burnt brick for example, Ibrahim As-Sahil designed a 
magnificent brick mosque in Gao, Timbuctu and a stone palace in Mali for Mansa Musa. 
xii. Trade 
Islam promoted trade between West Africa and the Mediterranean. The religion developed 
and widened the trans-Saharan Caravan trade. The trade enriched the West African and the 
Muslim traders. Muslims from North Africa came in their numbers and settled in the 
commercial centres. This helped in the development of the cities such as Timbuctu, Gao, 
Jenne and Kano. 
 
NEGATIVE EFFECTS 
The Islamic religion had a great effect on West African societies. In the first place, it 
challenged traditional African religion, weakening the basis on which some of the Sudanese 
states such as Kanem and ancient Ghana rested, contributing to their downfall. 
Secondly, it often divided the ruling group into Muslim and non-Moslem factions, conflict 
between which further weakened some of the states such as Songhai. 
Thirdly, the jihad not only caused periodic outbreaks of instability and chaosin the Western 
Sudan but also precipitated the downfall of some states like the Hanusa. 
From here it is important to understand the history of Islam in West Africa through different 
movements. So the remainder of the chapter looks at some key moments: the Almoravids 
and Ghana, the role of the Jakhanke the rise of Sokoto in Nigeria, and the importance of 
Omar Tal in the 19th century. 
 
A KEY PHASE IN ISLAMIZATION: THE ALMORAVID DYNASTY 
The term ‘Almoravid’ comes from the Arabic word ‘al-Murabit, literally meaning “one who is 
trying” but figuratively meaning “one who is ready for battle at a fortress”. 
The Almoravid dynasty was an imperial Berber Muslim dynasty centered in Morocco. It 
established an empire in the 11th century that stretched over the western Maghreb and Al-
Andalus. The dynasty was founded by Abdallah Ibn Yasin. The Almoravid capital was 
Marrakesh, a city which was the ruling house founded in 1062. The Gudala nomadic Berber 
tribes of the Sahara, traversing the territory between the Draa, the Niger and the Senegal 
rivers. 
The Almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of Al-Andalus to the Iberian Christian 
kingdoms, when they decisively defeated a coalition at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086. This 
enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers North to South, from 
Senegambia to Spain. 
Abdallah Ibn Yasin was a Gazzula Berber and probably a convert rather than a born Muslim. 
His name can be read as “son of Ya Sin”. Ibn Yasin certainly had the ardour of a puritan 
zealot, his creed was mainly characterised by a rigid formalising and a strict adherence to 
the dictates of the Quran and orthodox tradition. 
Ibn Yasin’s arguments were disputed by his audience. He responded to questioning with 
charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations. The 
Gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his 
protector, Yahaya Ibn Ibrahim, sometime in the 1040s. 
Ibn Yasin, however, found a more favourable reception among the neighbouring Lamtuna 
people. Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin’s pious fervor, the 
Lamtuna chieftain Yahya Ibn Umar al-Lamtuni invited the man to preach to his people. The 
Lamtuna leaders, however, kept Ibn Yasin on a careful leash, forging a more productive 
partnership between them. Invoking stories of the early life of Muhammed, Ibn Yasin 
preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough 
to merely adhere to God’s law, law was necessary to also destroy opposition to it. In Ibn 
Yasin’s ideology, anything and everything outside to Islamic law could be characterized as 
“opposition”. He identified tribalism, in particular, as an obstacle. He believed it was not 
enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences, and 
embrace the equality of all Muslims under the Sacred Law, it was necessary to make them 
do so. For the Lamtuna leadership, this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to 
refound the Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. In the early1050s, the 
Lamtuna, under the joint leadership of Yahya Ibn Umar and Abdallah Ibn Yasin-soon calling 
themselves the al-Murabitin (Almoravids)-set out on a campaign to bring their neighbours 
over to their cause. 
The Almoravid Conquest In Northern Africa 
From the year 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas 
of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert. After winning over the Sanhaja Berber 
tribe, they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route, seizing Sijilmasa at the 
northern end in 1054, and Aoudaghost at the southern end in 1055. Yahya Ibn Umar was 
killed in a battle in 1057, but Abdullah Ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was 
paramount named his brother Abu Bakr Ibn Umar as chief. Under him, the Almoravids soon 
began to spread their power beyond the desert, and conquered the tribes of the Atlas 
Mountains. They then came in contact with the Berghouata, a Berber tribal confederation, 
who followed an Islamic “heresy” preached by Salih Ibn Tarif three centuries earlier. The 
Berghouata resisted. Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed in battle with them in 1059, in Krifla, a 
village near Rommani, Morocco. They were, however, completely conquered by Abu Bakr 
Ibn Umar, and were forced to convert to orthodox Islam. Abu Bakr married a noble and 
wealthy Berber woman, Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat, who would become very influential in the 
development of the dynasty. Zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Houara, 
who was said to be from Kairouan. 
In 1061, Abu Bakr Ibn Umar made a division of the power he had established, handing over 
the more-settled parts to his cousin Yusuf Ibn Tashfin as viceroy, and also assigning to him 
his favourite wife Zaynab. Ibn Umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken 
out in the desert. When he returned to resume control, he found his cousin too powerful to 
be superseded. In Novermber 1087, Abu Bakr was killed in battle – according to oral 
tradition by an arrow, while fighting in the historic region of the Sudan. 
Yusuf Ibn Tashfin had in the meantime brought the large area of what is now known as 
Morocco, Western Sahara, and Mauritania into complete subjection. In 1062 he founded 
the city of Marrakech. In 1080, he conquered the kingdom of Tlemcen (in modern-day 
Algeria) and founded the present city of that name, his rule extending as far east as Oran. 
The Almoravid Conquest of the Ghana Empire 
According to Arab tradition, the Almoravids conquered the Ghana Empire sometime around 
1076. An example of this tradition is the record of historian Ibn Khaldun, who cited Shaykh 
Uthman, the faqih of Ghana, writing in 1394. According to this source, the Almoravids 
weakened Ghana and collected tribute from the Sudan, to the extent that the authority of 
the rules of Ghana dwindled away, and they were subjected and absorbed by the Soso, a 
neighboring people of the Sudan. Traditions in Mali related that the Soso attacked and took 
over Mali as well, and the ruler of the Soso, Sumaouro Kante (Sumanguru Kante) took over 
the land. 
 
DECLINE OF THE ALMORAVID DYNASTY 
Three years afterwards, under Yusuf's son and successor, Ali Ibn Yusuf, Sintra and Santarem 
in Portugal were added, and he invaded Iberia again in 1119 and 1121, but the tide had 
turned, as the French had assisted the Aragonese to recover Zaragoza. In 1138, Ali Ibn Yusuf 
was defeated by Alfonso VII of Leon, and in the Battle of Ourique (1139), by Afonso I of 
Portugal, who thereby won his crown. Lisbon was conquered by the Portuguese in 1147. 
According to some scholars, Ali Ibn Yusuf provided a new generation of leadership that had 
forgotten the desert life for the comforts of the city. He was defeated by the combined 
action of his Christian foes in Iberia and the agitation of Almohads (the Muwahhids) in 
Morocco. After Ali Ibn Yusuf’s death in 1143, his son Tashfin Ibn Ali lost ground rapidly 
before the Almohads. In 1146 he was killed in a fall from a precipice while attempting 
escape after a defeat near Oran. 
His two successors were Ibrahim Ibn Tashfin and Ishaq Ibn Ali, but their reigns were short. 
The conquest of the city of Marrakech by the Almohads in 1147 marked the fall of the 
dynasty, though fragments of the Almoravids (the Banu Ghanaiya,) continued to struggle in 
the Balearic Islands, and finally in Tunisia. 
Military organization 
Abdallah Ibn Yussin imposed very strict discipline measures on his forces for every breach of 
his laws The Almoravid first military leader, Yahya Ibn Umar al-Lamtuni, gave them a good 
military organization. Their main force was infantry, armed with javelins in the front ranks 
and pikes behind, which formed into a phalanx, and was supported by camelmen and 
horsemen on the flanks. They also had a flag carrier as the front who guided the forces 
behind him, when the flag was upright, the combatants behind would stand and when it 
was turned down, they would sit. 
Al-Bakri reports that, while in combat, the Almoravids did not pursue those who fled in front 
of them. Their fighting was intense and they did not retreat when disadvantage by an 
advancing opposing force, they preferred death over defeat. These characteristics were 
possibly unusual at the time. 
The Jakhanke Islamic Movement 
A history of Islam in West Africa cannot be complete without a mention, however brief, of 
the Jakhanke Islamic Movement which arose in the 12th century under the charismatic 
scholar Alhajj Salim Suwareh who helped to spread Islam in the present day countries of 
Mali, Guinea, Senegal and The Gambia, the most Islamized countries in West Africa today. 
The Jakhanke Islamization effort indeed have borne rich fruit! But let us begin by addressing 
the brass tacks: who were the Jakhanke? Why do they deserve attention in our study of the 
spread of Islam in West Africa? 
The highly regarded Gambian historian Lamin Sanneh who is also the leading authority on 
the Jakhanke calls the Jakhanke a ‘specialized caste’ of Muslim clerics and educators. ‘Caste’ 
gives them an aura of belonging to a bigger group, the Serahuli ethnic group also called 
Soninke in other writings. Today, they are erroneously categorized as Mandinka. They speak 
a dialect of Mandinka, but their ‘Mandikanization’ was largely because they were hosted by 
Mandinka chiefs when the Jakhanke moved from present day Republic of Mali to the 
Senegambia region. ‘Clerics and educators’ indicate their profession as literate and 
therefore able to proselytize and do missionary work. Apparently, the Jakhanke who are 
found in the Senegambia region today in large numbers do not put much premium on their 
ethnic origins but rather on their work as propagators of Islam in the past 800 years. 
This is exactly why the Jakhanke should interest us. They started a peaceful propagation of 
Islam in the Senegambia region. This is all the more relevant as we write today because of 
the rampant violence associated with Islam in many parts of the world. Much of the 
subsequent styles, and techniques associated with the peaceful spread of Islam in 
Senegambia is their creation. In a nutshell, they set the standards for missionary work. 
What were these standards? Chiefly, they professed the peaceful path to Islam. They did not 
raise the sword to spread the religion. They resorted to more peaceful methods such as 
establishing Koranic schools and mosques, upgrading of mosques, holding sessions on 
Koranic exegesis, preservation of holy sites where yearly Islamic gatherings take place and 
being itinerant traders who took Islam to their clients and customers. But just as they had 
methods, they also had tactics! For example, they believed in numbers and therefore were 
keen to multiply their talibes or disciples. The disciples having gone through years of 
tutelage, would be allowed to disperse and then mass up new disciples themselves. Through 
massification, the Jakhanke helped to strengthen their religion. Also, they had a tactic of 
withdrawing into enclaves far from the maddening crowds, so to speak. Generally, Jakhanke 
needed the quietude of the monastery and thus were very good at establishing theocratic 
entities sometimes deep in the Senegambian Savannah, where they developed self 
sustaining communities dedicated to Islamic scholarship and renditions. Sutukuho, 
Sutukung, in The Gambia and Niokhlo and Suna Karantba in Casamance are extant examples 
of such religious villages. 
So far absent in our discussion is the figure of Alhaji Salim Suwareh, the founder of the 
Jakhanke Islamic movement we have discussed above. He was a central in the success of the 
Jakhanke missionary work and therefore deserves our brief attention. His early life is 
shrouded in mystery, but a few strands deserve serious attention and are revealing. He died 
around 1500 and reputedly made seven pilgrimages to Mecca where he had relatives and 
lived before relocating to Black Africa to spread Islam, settling in the Jaka region of Masina, 
in present day Mali. Hence the name of his people Jakankhe, meaning in Mandinka ‘those 
who hail from Jaka’. When he completed his seventh hajj, he returned to Africa and stayed. 
He led his people from Jaka Masina to Jaka Bambuku. When the animist ruler of Bambuku 
became hostile, Suwareh did as the prophet of Islam did when Meccans started to throw 
stones at him: flee into exile. Suwareh led his band of talibes towards present day 
Senegambia. The historian Professor Sanneh writes that since this hijra or flight like 
movement, Jakhanke ‘have been united by a close bond of solidarity based on fidelity to 
Suwareh characterized by bonds of solidarity’. 
So dedicated were the Jakhanke to the spirit of peaceful spread of Islam that when a 
Serahuli religious hothead, Momodou Lamin Drammeh(1835-1887) opted to wage war to 
convert Bundu (eastern Senegal) into Islam, the Jakhanke disowned him and fled further 
down to present eastern Gambia. His swashbuckling style was quite in contrast to their 
orderly ways of Islamization! Without bearing the sword, the Jakhanke were able to fasten 
the spread and reform of Islam in contrast to the jihadist like Drammeh, Umar Taal, or Maba 
Jahou Bah. The paradox here may not be obvious but is palpable: how Jakhanke whose 
mentor, Suwareh, lived and had relatives in Mecca could have disavowed the 
uncompromising Wahabi doctrine to espouse the ‘path of accommodation’? 
To conclude therefore, what is the significance of the Jakhanke movement? Simply put, the 
Jakhanke epitomized peaceful and community led spread of Islam which made a deep 
impact on the recipient societies of Islam as the way of peace. The present day bomb 
throwers who claim to spread this religion by doing so may want to learn a lesson or two 
from the Jakhanke movement which started over 500 years ago

THE SOKOTO CALIPHATE 
 
Introduction 
Created by a jihad launched by Usman dan Fodio (also spelt Usman Ibn Fodio, Uthman Dan 
Fuduye, or Uthman Ibn Fodio) between 1804 and 1810, the caliphate of Sokoto was the 
largest and most populated state of nineteenth-century Africa. According to a nineteenth-
century account, it took four months to travel from west to east and two months to travel 
from north to south. The caliphate was organised as a decentralised state seeking to 
establish Islamic law over its large territory. The jihad and caliphate officially ended with the 
1903 British conquest, but has since been widely studied and its legacy endures today, 
especially in Nigeria. Many observers have tried to understand the jihad, the caliphate and 
especially the figure of Usman dan Fodio. The jihad, itself at the origin of a rich Islamic 
scholarship, has now given place to a wide and varied literature. 
 
The jihad and the creation of the caliphate 
For dan Fodio, the main reason for the jihad was the purification of Islam in territories which 
were already Muslim at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The legitimacy of his 
struggle stemmed from his belief that, until this point, Muslim leaders had only practiced an 
impure form of Islam. 
Some historians understood the jihad of Sokoto as a revolution because of the Hausa 
kingdoms’ socio-economical inequalities at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Dan 
Fodio’s success rests on his preference towards a form of equality and his proclaimed fight 
against corruption. As a champion of the people, dan Fodio launched his fight against the 
king and the aristocracy of Gobir in 1804. Even if the social dimension of the jihad should 
not be totally neglected, dan Fodio himself declared mainly religious reasons to be at the 
origin of the jihad in Kitab al-Farq. Correspondence exchanged with the leader of Borno in 
the 1800s is here revealing. After attempting to invade the kingdom that had existed since 
the ninth century, dan Fodio tried to convince Mohammed el-Kanemi of the religious and 
legal merits of his struggle. For dan Fodio, the jihad was mainly (but not only) conceived as a 
way of reforming lax Muslims by pure Muslims. 
In the 1970s, some historians stressed an ethnic dimension in the jihad of Sokoto. According 
to this interpretation, dan Fodio was the descendant of Fulanis installed in Hausa regions 
since the fifteenth century, and would have pitted Islam against Hausas. However, even if 
most leaders of the Sokoto jihad were Fulani, it is difficult to argue that the numerically 
inferior Fulani would have believed that they could have overthrown the Hausa kings on 
exclusively ethnic grounds. Dan Fodio himself wrote against any ethnic discrimination in his 
treatise Bayan Wayan Wujub al-Hijra. 
Scholars have also tried to show to what extent the jihad was not totally new in West Africa. 
Indeed discussions on the place of Islam in society had already taken place before the jihad 
of dan Fodio whether it was about food bans, marriage laws or clothes that women had to 
wear. It was this last point that had attracted the attention of Shaikh Jibril b. 'Umar, one of 
the masters of Usman dan Fodio. Other jihads had already taken place in West Africa before 
that of dan Fodio (Bundu, late seventeenth century, Futa Jallon, 1725, Futa Toro, 1776). In 
other words, some Muslim scholars had already become reformers-conquerors before the 
advent of Usman dan Fodio. 
The religious questioning of the jihad of dan Fodio was therefore not completely original. It 
is his lasting political victory over a vast territory that ensured his long-term success. 
 
 The structure and economy of the caliphate 
The first six years of jihad (1804-1810) were fundamental in the creation of a political and 
religious foundation for a state that was never an empire, but a collection of territories 
under the authority of the caliph in Sokoto. Indeed the Caliphate of Sokoto was a highly 
decentralised state ruled by the Caliph. The Caliphate itself was a novel phenomenon in the 
Hausa regions and conferred moral and political authority on dan Fodio and his successors. 
Companions of the caliph, Fulani scholars who had become jihadists, were thus placed as 
emirs at the head of each territorial subdivision who answered directly to the caliph. 
Because of its size, the caliphate became divided between the western emirates under the 
authority of Sokoto and the eastern emirates which remained more or less autonomous. 
The different successors of dan Fodio had to carry out military campaigns to assert their 
authority, thus making jihad a virtually uninterrupted phenomenon until the mid-nineteenth 
century. Mohammed Bello, dan Fodio’s son and direct successor, took the title of sultan and 
led many campaigns which he likened to the conquest of the Arabian Peninsula by the first 
Muslims in the seventh century. Bello's policy consisted of appointing family members as 
heads of frontier towns, settling Fulani nomadic populations in villages and building fortified 
villages to monitor some borders. It thus became necessary to ensure the security of the 
caliphate at its borders but also in the buffer zones between each emirate. Thanks to 
soldiers recruited during the dry season, the troops of Sokoto could quash any rebellion or 
Tuareg incursion from the north. 
The caliph's authority derived from his ability to control his borders, redistribute spoils from 
military campaigns or taxes to allies and members of his family. In replacing the taxes of the 
Hausa leaders by Islamic taxes like the zakat, revenues of the Caliphate were in theory 
subject to Islamic law. However, these taxes depended largely on each emirate with, for 
example, the existence of a property tax in Kano or Zaria outside of the emirate of Sokoto. 
Sokoto's centralizing tendencies on the rest of the caliphate were therefore limited by the 
pre-jihadic structures of the Hausa cities as well as the impossibility of reaching large parts 
of the population in the countryside. 
The caliphate of Sokoto, faithful to the original intentions of the jihad, looked to establish 
Islamic law in the courts of the whole caliphate. The need for educated men encouraged the 
emergence of schools in urban centres, even though the first years of the Caliphate were 
marked by a shortage of qualified personnel. Indeed, a defining feature of the Caliphate of 
Sokoto was the literate staff working in the administration of each emirate. Born free or in 
slavery, these men formed part of a functioning bureaucracy. 
It was once again the lack of labour which provoked the numerous expeditions with the aim 
of capturing slaves to either sell or to make work in the plantations and other places of 
production of the caliphate. Thus, work in the salt mines of the north of the caliphate was 
based on slave labour. The same applied to the iron, cotton, indigo, or leather industries of 
the central regions of the caliphate. The wealth of the state was therefore based on a servile 
economy fuelled by wars or raids. North African merchants provided a number of slaves in 
the town of Kano of the 1820s: for every freeman there were thirty slaves in the city. 
Islam, which had penetrated the Hausa regions during the fourteenth century via travellers / 
traders from neighbouring Borno and regions north of the Sahara, spread through jihad. The 
pre-Islamic religions, often called ‘traditional’ religions, persisted but the Islamic culture 
permeated the whole region through books written by the family of dan Fodio or sold 
through the Sahara. Whether through the pilgrimage to Mecca, trade or the dissemination 
of brotherhoods, the Hausa regions became more and more integrated with the Muslim 
world. While the phenomenon of integration within the Muslim world may have existed 
before, the jihad greatly accelerated the process.

The fall of the caliphate 
Following a brief British military campaign, the Sokoto Caliphate was incorporated into the 
protectorate of northern Nigeria in 1903. This date marks the defeat of the Sokoto Sultan 
against the British armies and the beginning of the colonial period. The British troops, as in 
was often the case in Africa, were essentially composed of Africans with European officers 
at their head. Involving predominantly Hausa soldiers, the British conquest might therefore 
also be understood as the result of an internal war in the Sokoto caliphate. Nevertheless, 
the Caliphate did not quite disappear entirely in 1903, as the British used the Sokoto 
Caliphate to build upon their theory of Indirect Rule. 
Factbox: 
The phrase ‘caliphate of Sokoto’ was not used by the inhabitants of the state created by the 
jihad in the nineteenth century. In fact, the term ‘caliphate’ was first coined by 
anthropologist Murray Last in 1967 in his seminal work, The Sokoto Caliphate. Last roots the 
term in the title assumed by Mohammed Bello and his successors. As amir al-Muminin, the 
sultan of Sokoto was the de facto caliph; a title that was also used by the rulers of 
neighbouring Borno between the end of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the 
nineteenth century.

AL HAJJ UMAR TAL AND THE OMARIEN DYNAMIC IN WEST AFRICA 
If Alhaji Salim Suwareh did not raise the sword to spread Islam, Al Hajj Umar Tal (1797-1864) 
did and with as much success as the Jakhanke missionaries. Before we examine his eventful 
life, we might as well start our discussion with his swift jihads in present day Mali and 
Guinea Conakry which lasted from 1848-1864. His first target was the gold states of Bambuk 
and Bure then ruled by and inhabited by animist Malinke. Within a short period of six years 
between 1848-1854, he conquered and forcibly converted the Malinke of Bandjogou, 
Bougary and Farabana all in present day Republic of Guinea Conakry. He raised the flag of 
Tijaninya sect of Islam and pitched his tent at Jalafara, his first capital. His success pushed 
him to attack the Bambaras of Kaarta and Segou, and the animist Fulani of Macina, in 
present day Republic of Mali. By 1854 Tal had established a huge Muslim state which 
included aarta, Segou, Macina, and Khasso. He had brought the only well organized fighting 
force in this part of the Sahel, the Bambara, into submission under his Tijaniya sect. The 
eminent Malian historian Sekene Mody Cissokho commented ‘Al hajj Umar brought Islam to 
the Western Sudan’ a worthy accolade to this brilliant scholar turned jihadist and empire 
builder. 
But this success was apparent even in his early year. At the age of 23 in 1820, he had 
finished his studies and was awarded the title ‘alfa’ or scholar. In the same year, he made a 
pilgrimage to Mecca and stayed in Arabia for 13 years, and was ordained the Kalifa or 
emissary of the Tijaniya sect in West Africa. He had now gotten the recognition and stamp 
of approval to lead the jihads in the Sahel. He briefly passed through Kanem Borno, Sokoto 
where jihads had just been completed and must have learnt some lessons on how to 
prepare his own in the Sahel. 
Cissokho tells us that Umar’s aim was less to destroy existing polities but more to convert 
their rulers and people from animism into Tijaniay Islam or from Qadriya into Tinjaniya. But 
we must not attribute his quick success to the sword of the Jihad alone; Umar’s version of 
Tijaniya was also pro poor, and socially uplifting. He was quick to free slaves for example in 
conquered territories and assisted the poor and down trodden to meet their basic needs. 
Until he met his demise at Dinguiray in 1864 after a bloody encounter with the French, he 
remained the popular jihadist turned empire builder. His son Amadou Seku replaced him 
but struggled to wield together the vast Imamate his father had wrought.

4 - European Contact with West Africa 
 
European sailors first reached sub-Saharan Africa in 1442, when Portuguese ships reached 
the Senegal river. The Portuguese had been sailing the coasts of Morocco and Western 
Sahara since 1413, when they captured the Moroccan city of Ceuta [still a Spanish city 
today]. Between 1413 and the 1440s, the Portuguese established several fortified 
settlements along the Moroccan coast, especially at Arzila, Mogador (now Essaouira), Safi, 
and Tangier; they retained a strong presence in Morocco until 1578, when the Portuguese 
King Sebastião I and much of the Portuguese nobility were killed at the Battle of Alcácer-
Quibir. By 1471, West African leaders between the coasts of Senegal and Ghana had 
established commercial and diplomatic connections with Portuguese traders [major early 
sites of trade and settlement were on the Gambia river, Bugendo on the São Domingos river 
in Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone]. 
For the next 150 years, West African rulers and traders came across the Portuguese more 
than any other European nation. [There were also smaller trading missions led by the 
English and the French, but these were less frequent]. In the beginning, the Portuguese 
main motivations were: 1, an interest in the extensive gold production of Bono-Mansu and 
the Akan states; 2, competition with the Ottoman Empire to access this gold [the Ottomans 
had captured Constantinople in 1453, prompting a crisis in Christian Europe]; 3, the desire 
to find a trade route to markets in India around the Cape of Good Hope; 4, ever increasingly, 
the trade in enslaved persons. 
By the 1590s, the Dutch began to rival the Portuguese as the major European trading nation 
in Africa. Their ships were bigger and better, and the goods they traded with African political 
leaders were of much higher quality. The Dutch had captured many of the main Portuguese 
trading stations in West Africa by 1650, especially at Gorée in Senegal (in 1621), at Elmina in 
Ghana (in 1637), and at Luanda in Angola (in 1641). Initially the Dutch were mainly 
interested in textiles, animal hides [for the leather industry], and ivory, but by the middle of 
the 17th century they too turned to slave trading. The Dutch interest in slave trading dates to 
the 1620s and the capture of half of the Brazilian colonies from the Portuguese. From 1630 
to 1654 the Dutch controlled the northern part of Brazil, and the associated sugar 
plantations which used the labour of enslaved persons; their growing colonial interests 
drove their interest in slave trading, which took over in the second half of the 18th century. 
In the second half of the 17th century, other European nations would follow this pattern. 
Danish, English, French, German, and Swedish traders established factories at various points 
in West Africa, and this pattern of African-European trade and interaction deepened. 
This chapter looks especially at the early period of African-European interaction, to 1650, 
before the trade in enslaved persons came to predominate in trade. The chapter on the 
trans-Atlantic slave trade then looks at that historical aspect in more detail. 
I: Immediate Causes of Portuguese Sailings to Africa 
Europe in the 14th century was in a bad way. It is estimated that the spread of Plague 
between 1346 and 1353 led to the deaths of between 30 and 50% of the European 
population. Some archaeologists also believe that this Plague had an impact in West African 
populations [the evidence for this remains challenged, but it is an interesting hypothesis; 
the archaeologist Gérard Chouin has been the strongest proponent of this idea]. 
With the population collapse, European nations such as Portugal faced many problems. 
Their workforce had more than halved, which meant that much farming land was taken over 
by forests and plants. Interestingly, one of the first sources available on the West African 
presence in Portugal, from the Portuguese Cortes or parliament at Évora in 1471, says that 
African labourers were vital for clearing wastelands in the country: this suggests a strong 
labour shortage in Europe after the Plague, and the role of African labour in addressing this. 
Many of the nobles had lost their labourers [known as serfs], and civil wars resulted in 
Portugal in the 1380s. There was both a shortage of wheat to make bread, and very high 
inflation of the Portuguese currency [known as the escudo]. Both of these factors prompted 
the Portuguese interest in Morocco, since, 1, Morocco was a fertile country and a grower of 
wheat; and 2, the Portuguese hoped that through sailing along the coast of West Africa, 
they might find access to West African gold supplies and protect their currency. 
By contrast to the situation in Europe, many states in West Africa in the 15th century were in 
a process of expansion and growth. Mossi was established in the 15th century in Burkina 
Faso, Kano became a major power, and Songhay rose to usurp the power of the Mali 
Empire. Much of this growth came with increased gold production in the Akan states of 
Ghana. So much gold was produced that the trans-Saharan trade did not bring enough 
goods to exchange at Kano, and many gold traders left empty-handed [this is according to 
the early 16th-century Muslim traveller from southern Spain known generally as Leo 
Africanus]. 
The Portuguese were aware of this growth through a number of channels. The Catalan Atlas 
of c.1375 was a map drawn by a Majorcan Jew called Abraham Cresques, which showed the 
power of Mali and its gold production in detail. 
Catalan Atlas, by Cresques Abraham, Wikicommons; Mansa Musa at bottom - Unknown, 
Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=670189 
The Atlas showed good trade connections between Spain and West Africa via the Sahara, 
often undertaken by Jewish traders. These traders spread news about West Africa in Spain 
and Portugal. There were Jewish communities in Saharan settlements such as Tuat, and 
after riots against Spanish Jews in 1391 more settled in Morocco and worked in the carpet 
and textile trade to and from the Mali Empire. 
Knowing something of the conditions in Africa, therefore, Portuguese leaders were keen to 
make connections with West African gold producers [Portugal also had a large Jewish 
population]. They also hoped to meet with a Christian King who they called Prester John, 
and who they believed lived somewhere in Africa. They wanted a Christian alliance against 
the Islamic Ottoman Empire, which was growing in power; and to divert some of the gold 
supply. Prester John probably referred to the Christian King of Ethiopia, but this was not 
known at the time. 
All of these factors shaped the Portuguese voyages to West Africa, and their arrival at the 
Senegal river in 1442. 
 
II: Portuguese voyages: key dates, patterns, and timelines 
After reaching the Senegal river in 1442, the Portuguese voyages continued. By 1448, some 
of their people had sailed up the Gambia river as far as the major trading town of Kantora, 
not far east of what is today Basse Santa Su [in the far east of the country; Kantora was then 
a major centre for the trans-Saharan trade]. By the mid-1450s, there was trade with the 
Wolof state of Kajoor on the coast, and the Bijagós Islands off the coast of Guinea-Bissau 
had entered discussions with European traders. The initial language of communication was 
probably Arabic: Arabic speakers were many in Portugal in the 15th century, where Granada 
was still as Islamic kingdom in Spain, and of course was widely spoken in many parts of West 
Africa. One sailor described in 1456 how the Bijagós was the last place where the African 
peoples shared a language with the Portuguese sailors, and so this was also probably the 
southernmost extent of Arab and Trans-Saharan trade at that time. The Cape Verde Islands 
were first reached probably in 1456 [a lively discussion exists among Capeverdean historians 
as to whether there was already a population; archaeological evidence is inconclusive, but 
the islands may have been a salt depot for Saharan states], and the coastline of Ghana 
followed in around 1471. 
The coastline of Ghana was different because it was so close to the gold mines of the Akan 
forests. Soon Akan traders sold gold informally to the Portuguese. The Portuguese state 
wanted its share, and so the Portuguese sent a large fleet in 1481 and negotiated with 
Kwamena Ansa, ruler at Edina [now called Elmina], to build a fortress. When the 
negotiations were concluded [after a highly tense stand-off, which began when the 
Portuguese tried to build their fort at the site of a holy shrine], the fortress at Elmina was 
built, and still remains on what became known as the Gold Coast. It would later change 
hands and become a Dutch fortress in the 17th century; and in time the Dutch and English 
would be the main European nations trading in Ghana. 
Because there was so much commerce on the Gold Coast, many different Akan rulers were 
keen to expand their trading connections. The Portuguese built forts in other locations along 
the Gold Coast, such as Axim and Komenda, many of which were completed by 1500. In 
time there would be many more forts, almost every few miles along the Gold Coast; some 
would be specialists in the gold trade, and others, such as Anishan, in exporting the corn 
which was also in high demand from European ships. It would not be until the 18th century 
that the slave trade would come to predominate on the Gold Coast. 
Meantime, other rulers from West and West-Central Africa were making contact with the 
Portuguese. Oba Ozolua of Benin received Portuguese visitors in 1485, and the Atlantic 
trading post of Gwatón was founded around 1490. Benin initially sold malaguetta peppers 
to the Portuguese, but after the sea route to India was established in 1499, Benin’s peppers 
became less in demand in Europe. The Portuguese tried to establish a trade in enslaved 
persons from Benin to the gold suppliers in Elmina, but the Oba refused. Over the 16th 
century, Benin’s relations with the Portuguese declined, until in the early 17th century the 
Obas renewed links with European traders given the Dutch demand for the cloth produced 
in Benin. Throughout the 17th century cloth remained the main export of Benin, and the 
ambassy cloths were traded regularly to Elmina, and as far afield as Brazil. However demand 
fell in the late 17th century, as imports of luxury cloths from India grew. This meant that by 
the 18th century Benin’s Obas had finally to turn to the trade in enslaved persons to 
preserve and renew the power of Edo and the Benin state. 
The Portuguese continued to voyage south after Benin, reaching the mouth of the Kongo 
river and establishing relations with the manikongo at Mbanza Kongo [the capital of Kongo], 
Nzika Nkuwu. The island of São Tomé was settled by 1485, and many BaKongo peoples were 
taken there as enslaved persons to work on the sugar plantations. In 1491, Nzika Nkuwu 
converted to Christianity and took the name Joao I. This led also to connections between 
Kongo and Elmina through São Tomé, which traded with both. Indeed, by the 1510s, traders 
from Benin were mentioned as present at the Kongolese port of Mpinda in a letter written 
in Portuguese by the new manikongo Afonso I (1509-46). 
By the 1510s, therefore, many different peoples of West Africa and their rulers had 
established connections with the Portuguese. Some, such as those at Benin and Elmina had 
connections further south, to Kongo. African rulers hoped to expand their trading contacts; 
and at times to obtain military support against rivals, as was the case with both Benin (who 
fought a major battle with Portuguese support against Nupe, in 1516) and in civil wars in 
Jolof and Kongo. 
III: Exchanges of ambassadors 
Diplomacy and royal exchanges characterised the first decades of West African relationships 
with Portugal. It was common for princes of Benin, Jolof and Kongo to spend time studying 
in Portugal, or to be sent by their royal elders as ambassadors to the Portuguese court. This 
continued into the 17th century, when Kongo sent ambassadors to the Dutch colonial court 
in Brazil, to the home of the Catholic Church at the Vatican, as well as to Portugal. In the 
1650s, Allada also sent ambassadors to the Spanish court. This pattern continued later, 
when Dahomey sent ambassadors 5 times to the Portuguese in Brazil and Portugal between 
1755 and the 1810s. Indeed, when Brazil declared independence from Portugal in 1811, it 
was Dahomey which was the first state to recognise its independence. 
The Portuguese also saw these relationships as diplomatic. Under the reign of João II (1481-
95), the Portuguese sent ambassadors to many royal courts in Africa: to Benin, Kongo, and 
to the court of the Mandimansa, the emperor of Mali [one envoy was sent as far as 
Timbuktu, but it is not certain that he arrived]. Letters sent by the Portuguese kings to West 
African rulers conceived of them as fellow monarchs. In both Africa and Portugal, kingship 
was a divine gift, creating some commonality. 
Fortunately some portraits survive of these ambassadors. The most important were painted 
in Brazil by a Dutch artist [probably Jasper Beckx], and were of Dom Miguel de Castro. 
Miguel de Castro was the ambassador of the court of the manikongo, Garcia II Ncana a 
Luquini nzenze atumba, who sent him as an envoy to the Dutch court in Brazil, probably in 
1643: 
Dom Miguel de Castro, by Jaspar Beckx, sometimes attributed to Albert Eckhout, public 
domain 
The aims of these embassies were quite varied. They can be broadly summarised in three 
categories: 
1) The quest for a military alliance. Two good examples can be given of this. 
:- The first dates from 1488, when the Jolof prince Bumi Jeléen came to Portugal. He claimed 
rightful possession of the throne of Jolof, but had been unseated by his brothers/rivals, and 
had come to Portugal for assistance. He was received at court by João II, who sent a military 
fleet to support Bumi Jeléen on his return to the Senegal river. However, Bumi Jeléen was 
treacherously murdered by the leader of the fleet when they reached West Africa [this 
individual, Pero Vaz de Cunha, claimed that he suspected Bumi Jeléen of betraying them]. 
This was an ignominious episode; many of the leaders of this plot against the Jolof prince 
were put to death by João II, and the followers and relatives of Bumi Jeléen moved to the 
Cape Verde islands [which by then were under Portuguese control]. 
:- The second relates to this expedition by Dom Miguel de Castro. In the 1640s, the Kingdom 
of Kongo had allied with the Dutch against the Portuguese. The Dutch seized Luanda in 
1641, and then Kongo armies fought against Portuguese troops stationed at their forts 
[Ambaca and Massangano] in the interior of Angola. In this embassy, Dom Miguel de Castro 
had been sent by the manikongo to discuss military strategy and how to throw the 
Portuguese out for good from West-Central Africa. However this alliance was finally 
defeated in 1648. 
2) Interest in Christianity 
Another factor in these embassies was the interest which some African peoples had in 
Christianity. Princes from Benin studied in Portuguese missions, as did those from Kongo. 
While the interest in Christianity waned in Benin, in Kongo it did not, and ambassadors were 
sent to the Vatican repeatedly asking for more priests and missionaries, long into the 17th 
century. In the 1670s, over a dozen members of the Ndongo royal family spent many years 
studying in a variety of monasteries and convents in Portugal [as new research by the 
historian José Lingna Nafafé is showing]. Allada, too, sent requests to Spain for missionaries 
in the middle of the 17th century; by this time the climate was becoming unpredictable, and 
there were frequent floods, so the king of Allada hoped that the Christian priests might be 
able to intercede with divinities and prevent these. 
3) Commercial activity 
Trade was often a motivation in the despatching of ambassadors by West African kings. 
Access to Atlantic trade was an important way of expanding supplies of money. Just as 
today there is the Cedi, Dalasi, Leone, and Naira, so in the past many types of money were 
in use in different parts of West Africa, such as cowries, iron bars, and cloth strips. More 
specifically, these were: 1, gold, especially on the Niger Bend and in the Akan kingdoms of 
the Gold Coast; 2, cowries, in Benin, Oyò, on the Niger Bend, and later in Hueda and 
Dahomey; 3, copper rods, on the Gold Coast and in Calabar; 4, iron bars, in Senegambia, and 
on the Gold Coast; 5, strips of cloth, used widely in Senegambia, Sierra Leone, and in parts 
of the Gold Coast and Oyò. These currencies had all been in use before the arrival of 
European traders. The Atlantic trade then expanded the money supply that was available, 
and thus also helped to grow market exchanges. By negotiating with European monarchs, 
many West African rulers hoped to grow their access to currency, and thus the size of their 
tax revenue, and the power of their state. In the 1620s, this saw smaller kingdoms along the 
Gold Coast sending embassies to the Dutch; while this was also a clear motivation in the 
embassies sent by Allada in the 1650s. Five embassies sent by Dahomey to Brazil and 
Portugal in the later 18th and early 19th century all had commercial aims. 
By this time, the royal family of Dahomey had become experts in fine living in the capitals of 
Brazil and Portugal. The embassies sent in 1795 are a good case in point. Ttravelling first to 
Salvador, in Brazil, the two ambassadors spent large sums on fine silk and damask clothing 
and hats all of it paid for by the Portuguese crown. They then moved on to Lisbon late in the 
year, and when they arrived they visited the theatre and the opera every night. 
The diplomatic element of African-European relations shows that these took place on a 
scale of grand politics, as well as at a local level. West African rulers’ interests were those of 
many leaders anywhere: commercial and military success, and religious belief. Yet while the 
Portuguese crown also despatched many embassies initially, by the 1530s the European 
presence was becoming increasingly “informal”, as small-scale traders took over. 
IV: European Trading Communities in West Africa 
There were two main types of European trading community in West Africa: 1, informal 
communities, where Europeans settled, married women from the area, and with them 
formed African families who often became important in local trade networks; 2, more 
formal communities which grew up in the fortified trading posts along the coast, or factories 
[from the Portuguese word feitoria] that were especially found along the Gold Coast, in 
Hueda, and also in the rivers around Gambia and Bissau [especially the Gambia, Casamance, 
São Domingos, Corubal, Nunez and Pongo rivers]. 
The fortified factories were often modelled on Elmina, which was the first, oldest, and 
biggest of these trading posts. This shows the importance of the gold trade to begin with, 
dating to the 1480s, when Elmina was built. However apart from Elmina and other smaller 
forts on the Gold Coast, in the 1500s the informal model of trade was more usual. Male 
Portuguese traders came to areas such as Senegambia, the rivers of Guinea-Bissau, Sierra 
Leone, and Benin. Here they married, and often acted as trading intermediaries with local 
rulers, as they, their wives (and their children) were able to speak both African and 
European languages. 
One of these traders became quite famous in Senegambia in the 16th century. Known as 
“Ganagoga”, this Portuguese man had originally been called João Ferreira. He married the 
daughter of the ruler of Fùùta Tòòro [on the Senegal river]. His name “Ganagoga” meant 
“he who speaks all the languages” in the Biafada language of Guinea-Bissau, which shows 
how important this ability was. 
It seems that relations with daughters of the ruling families was not unusual for these 
traders. In another case in the early 17th century, one Dutch Jewish trader got into problems 
after having had an affair with the daughter of the Buur of Kajoor in Senegal. 
Some historians think that these early traders also often took on religious roles. The 
Portuguese called those of their nation who settled in Africa “tangomãos” in the 1500s. This 
word derived from the name of a shrine in Sierra Leone, tunguma. According to one writer 
in 1506, one of the earliest Portuguese men to settle in Sierra Leone [in the 1480s] had 
officiated at this shrine at the request of the Temni peoples there [though Sierra Leone’s 
human communities changed a lot in the 16th century, with the arrival of a wave of Mande-
influenced warriors called the Manes, who defeated the warriors of existing communities 
and then intermarried with them by 1600]. “Tangomão” therefore meant a European 
person who both settled in West Africa, and adopted West African beliefs and practices. 
In many of these communities, it was the African women married to these male traders who 
ran the trading networks. Their male European spouses were often ill with malaria and 
other diseases to which they had no physical resistance. These men looked awful, and spent 
much of their time in bed before dying young. Female traders spoke African languages much 
better, of course. They could form trading and human networks with their home 
communities, and run the day to day aspects of the business while their male spouses 
fought weakly with disease [some historians think that the strong role of women traders in 
these areas influenced the powerful place that women took in some independence 
movements against colonial rule in the 20th century, especially in Guinea-Bissau and parts of 
Nigeria]. 
A good example of one of these cases comes from Guinea-Bissau in the middle of the 17th 
century. In the factory of Cacheu, the most powerful traders in the 1660, 1670s, and 1680s 
were two women called Bibiana Vaz and Crispina Peres. Peres was married to a Portuguese 
trader, but he was so ill that she ran the couple’s business. She made so many enemies 
through her business acumen that she was eventually captured by the Portuguese 
Inquisition and deported to Lisbon, where she was tried in 1664 for “fetishism” as a crime 
against Catholic Christianity. Vaz, meanwhile, was so powerful that she kept the Portuguese 
Governor of Cacheu prisoner in the passageway of her house in Farim for 18 months in the 
1690s. 
These mixed communities were more influenced by African than by European practices and 
behaviour. It was important to be able to speak European languages and to write to get the 
best trade terms with Europeans, but marriage and inheritance was carried out according to 
the local practice of wherever the European had settled. This encouraged the Portuguese to 
settle where inheritance passed through the female line [matrilineal societies]. In these 
places, such as Guinea-Bissau and on the Gold Coast, the children which a European had 
with his African wife would inherit rights, social status, and property according to the laws 
of that society. However, where inheritance passed through the male line [patrilineal 
societies], the children of these marriages would inherit no social or property rights, since 
their fathers had been born with none, being Europeans [a good example is in Senegambia, 
where very few European men settled after the 1550s]. 
These informal communities concentrated on trade. They helped African rulers to expand 
their trading connections. They could help to negotiate with European traders and ships 
who stopped only for a while, and to get the best price. Some of these families retained the 
connection to Europe, sending children to study in European countries into the 18th century, 
and becoming rich merchants of the coastal towns. Most more or less shook off their 
European past, and became fully integrated into the African societies, where their male 
European forefathers had settled as stranger-guests of their African landlord kings. 
As noted, these informal settlements were in the majority in the 16th century. However, 
towards the end of that century and in the early 17th century fortified European trading 
posts became common, especially on the Gold Coast and in Hueda. In Casamance and 
Guinea-Bissau, they were formed in settlements such as Cacheu (1589), Ziguinchor (1645), 
and Bissau (1687). The 17th century also saw the establishment of the fort at James Island 
(1651), at the estuary of the Gambia river. Along the Gold Coast, the Dutch presence saw 
increasing number of castles being established, the most famous being at Cape Corso (Cape 
Coast, built in 1610 and expanded in 1652) and Sekondi (1642), as well as those already 
mentioned at Axim and Elmina. 
The huge expansion of the Atlantic slave trade in the late 17th century saw the growth of this 
model of European settlement. European factories at Offra (1660, the port for Allada) and at 
Hueda were fortified. By the middle of the 18th century, these communities of European 
settlers had become more important than the informal ones noted above; by this time, 
members of these informal communities had by and large settled and fully integrated into 
their host African communities. 
Although these communities were protected militarily, they relied very heavily on African 
intermediaries in their trade. The military captains of these forts also often attended and 
participated in royal ceremonies of the local African state (as often happened in Dahomey, 
for instance), and also would send gifts for the funeral rites of any deceased person of 
importance. In practice, this meant that they had to accept and participate in African 
religious practices, associated with these funerals. 
Nevertheless, the communities which grew up around these fortified trading posts were 
quite different to the informal communities noted above. The military aspect was vital. 
Although European traders rented the land for their posts, they were as much occupiers as 
they were tenants. They had armed militias, and often allied with one local ruler or another, 
which could create problems between them [it is important to remember that by the 18th 
century, guns were one of the larges imports from the Atlantic trade to Africa; this had 
changed a lot from previous centuries, where copper, iron, and cloth had also been 
important]. They were accustomed to slavery, and brought with them the racial animus 
which became especially bad in Europe from around 1650 onwards. They were therefore 
used to having “castle slaves” [an idea imported from Europe, via the experience in the New 
world plantation societies], something which influenced practices of service and 
dependence in local communities. 
Many of the European officials in these forts had families with African women, and their 
children who grew up around these forts often became traders, as their dual heritage gave 
them access to both the worlds of their African and European parents. Some of these 
families became important figures in local politics. In this sense there was a continuity from 
the more informal communities discussed above. However the military presence and the 
growth of slavery meant that in many important respects these communities had become 
very different by the 18th century. 
V: The Nature of Trade 
Europeans came to Africa mainly for trade, and this was the almost exclusive cause of their 
coming. By and large they arrived hoping for a short stay and to become rich. Some then 
realised the many riches to be found beyond material wealth, and stayed to form families 
who became part of their host communities. But even then, the commercial aspect was 
always important. 
For African rulers, trade brought many opportunities. In the first two centuries, they 
demanded especially currency materials. Cloth was one of the largest items imported, from 
India and Europe; some cargoes of Dutch ships in the early 17th century consisted almost 
entirely of cloth, shipped to Senegambia and the Gold Coast. Indeed, cloth remained 
important through the 18th and 19th centuries; the so-called pièce de guinée, an indigo-dyed 
blue cloth made near Pondichéry in India, was imported by the French to Senegambia and 
used as a currency on the Upper Senegal River throughout this time. Cloth was used as 
money in Senegambia, and also as a currency in parts of Angola and the Gold Coast. Copper 
was also a major import, especially to Benin and the Gold Coast, and iron bars were also 
significant [in both the Gold Coast and Senegambia, iron bars needed to be branded with 
the mark of the European trading company, such as the OWIC (Dutch West Indian Company) 
or RAC (English Royal African Company), otherwise African traders would give them less 
value]. Cowries were imported from the Maldives to Benin from as early as 1505. 
This period also saw the import of jewels, and some manufactured goods like mirrors and 
basins. But the value of each imported cargo consisted mainly of goods which could be 
converted into currency. Evidence suggests that the imported metals such as copper and 
iron were brought in specific dimensions for trade: copper rings (or manillas) and iron bars 
of a specified length [especially in Senegambia] which were used then as mediums of 
exchange. The metals were then melted down by smiths for use in agricultural tools, 
weapons, and artistic works (in the case of Benin, the Benin bronzes) [there was a large 
increase in production of the bronzes in the 16th century, when copper imports grew; the 
bronzes had been important from before, but their production expanded then].

It is important to recognise the shift that then happened in the second half of the 17th 
century, when currency imports declined, and were replaced by especially luxury items of 
consumption such as alcohol and tobacco (especially from Brazil), and also by guns and 
gunpowder. The Nigerian historian Joseph Inikori sees this change as accompanying a 
slowing down in African economic growth. The lack of currency imports was symptomatic of 
a market which had stopped growing, and did not need so much money to function in 
exchange. 
One can say by contrast that until the second half of the 17th century, the trade between 
Africa and Europe was quite balanced. Until then, while African rulers wanted increased 
supplies of currency, Europeans did not only focus on the slave trade, as later became the 
case. They also wanted to import gold and ivory. Places such as Allada, Benin, Cape Verde, 
Loango, and the rivers of Cameroon and Gabon all exported cloth, and some of this was sold 
as far afield as Brazil, Curação [a Caribbean island near the coast of Venezuela, belonging to 
the Dutch] and the United States in the 17th century [indeed Oyò cloth was traded to Yorubà 
communities in Brazil throughout the 18th and into the 19th century, and marketwomen of 
Yorubà ancestry in Brazil worked as “cloth sellers” (vendedoras de panos) into the 19th 
century in Salvador, Brazil]. When the Dutch invaded Portuguese colonies in Brazil in 1630, 
the Portuguese colonists formed an army which included many Africans from the Gold Coast 
and Angola; the Gold Coast contingent demanded particular cloths as part of their payment 
and apparel, which was sent specially from the Dutch fortress at Elmina. 
It was not just the West African textile industry which found markets overseas in the 16th 
and 17th centuries. Basketwork made by Gold Coast communities was highly prized in 
Holland in the early 17th century. Ivory carvings made by the Sape peoples of Sierra Leone 
were found in different parts of Europe, turned into everyday items such as salt cellars and 
candle holders which were part of the export trade from this part of West Africa [in the 20th 
century colonial era, some European art historians assumed these ivories came from Benin; 
however it has now been established by the American art historian Peter Mark that they 
came from Sierra Leone].

In sum, the Europeans who settled in Africa did so as part of a commercial enterprise. Their 
trading presence in West Africa began as one which was more or less between equal trading 
partners. As the diplomatic embassies show, each party saw the others as kings and rulers 
of their lands by divine power. Each, too, imported money from the other (the Europeans 
importing gold, the Africans importing copper, cowries, cloth, and iron). There was an 
Atlantic slave trade, but it was not as important as it later became [the Atlantic slave trade 
remained quite minor in West Africa until the 1640s; it had expanded a lot in Angola after 
1580, with a trade to Brazil and the rest of Latin America, but this is in West-Central Africa: it 
was only in Senegambia that the slave trade was at all important in West Africa until the 
1640s, when it began to grow in Allada and Calabar]. 
However the later 17th century saw a change, and with that a different pattern in European 
settlement and trade in West Africa. By this time, the slave trade was dominating, and 
Europeans were settling in fortified trading positions, and not informally with their African 
hosts. The economic terms of trade were in general less equal, and that remained the case 
through the 18th century. 
VI: Environmental Change, Competition and Changes in the European Presence 
The first half of the 17th century saw many changes in these patterns, as we are seeing. 
These changes were vital in West Africa. They were also part of changes that were taking 
place around the world, which saw wars and revolutions in places as different as China and 
Europe, as well as in Africa. 
The main causes of these transformations were: (1), Environmental pressures brought on by 
the “mini ice age” (reaching a peak in the 1640s); and (2), Political competition brought on 
by the emergence of the capitalist world system. 
(1), The environmental pressures were part of a big change in the world’s climate, generally 
known as the “mini ice age”. From the 1570s onwards, there was a major cooling in the 
world’s temperatures. This produced climatic difficulties. In Africa, there were droughts in 
Angola (from around 1600) and Senegambia (from around 1640), and floods in Yorubà-
speaking areas of Nigeria and Benin (in the early 17th century). There were heavy snows in 
Morocco. When the King of Allada sent ambassadors to Spain in the 1650s, he said that one 
of the reasons was an attempt to stop the terrible storms which Allada had been 
experiencing. 
Major problems occurred in other parts of the world. The freezing temperatures made 
harvests of wheat and other crops much worse than before, and food prices rose. Some of 
the coolest temperatures of all occurred around 1640. This was also when the biggest 
revolutions began. In China, a civil war began which saw the overthrow of the Ming dynasty. 
In Europe, Portugal declared independence from Spain also in 1640 and a civil war began 
which lasted until 1668; a civil war also began in England in 1641, when the King was 
deposed and executed, and there was also civil conflict in France. 
What caused this fall in temperatures, and the political crises? European historians 
traditionally pointed to different patterns of the sun. A team of archaeologists based in 
Colombia have a new explanation. The European conquest of the Americas in the 16th 
century is usually thought to have caused a population collapse of indigenous Americans. 
Latest estimates suggest 90% of the Native American population died from disease and war 
– perhaps 10-15% of the entire world population. The fall in the indigenous American 
population led to, (a), increasing areas of forest taking over settlements and farmland, and 
(b), less deforestation and burning of fires; the growth of forest absorbed Carbon Dioxide 
pollution, and there was also less Carbon Dioxide created through the burning of fires [in 
keeping with today’s analysis of causes of global warming in the 21st century, which 
understands this as a relationship of carbon emissions and carbon capture]. According to 
the Colombian archaeologists, this led to the fall in temperatures. 
(2), Political competition rose with growth in trade and the power of the states that could 
control it. In West Africa, it was becoming important to develop trading relationships with 
European partners. Those states which did so prospered, but there could also be a cost. 
With larger kingdoms, such as Jolof and Kongo, their coastal provinces [Kajoor in Jolof and 
Nsoyo in Kongo] became more powerful and broke away from central control [by the 1550s 
in Kajoor, and in the early 17th century in Nsoyo]. Meantime rival rulers sought to open 
trading stations, and struggled with one another for best access to international trade. This 
created both conflict, and increased demand for European trade, and led to the huge 
number of fortified trading posts built along the Gold Coast, and the coasts of Hueda and 
Allada in the second half of the 17th century. 
At the same time, there was competition among Europeans, who often struggled with one 
another for the best access to African trade. It is worth noting that although there was fierce 
competition between different European nations to trade, this never led to direct military 
confrontations between them in Africa in this period. Wars fought by European nations 
were fought in Europe itself, where in Africa European traders were competing as part of a 
shared cooperative agenda and structure of trade. By the second half of the 17th century, 
Danish, Dutch, English, French and German trading companies were all seeking to establish 
a foothold in West Africa, bringing the best and most fashionable trading commodities and 
negotiating with one another to exchange what they had to make up the best “assortment”. 
The competition among European traders meant that African rulers could often strike better 
bargains. They could play off one against another to get the best price. But it also meant 
that they had to meet the demands of traders if these were not to move on elsewhere in 
search of captives, ivory and gold. Mutual dependence of African rulers and European 
traders grew; and the increasingly fragile environment, in Africa as elsewhere in the world, 
created frequent problems of food and resources which could often lead to conflict. 
Conclusion 
In sum, factors of environmental change and economic competition created a difficult 
situation in many parts of West Africa by the later 17th century. The terms of the European 
presence changed decisively towards one of slave trading based from fortified castles and 
trading posts, and away from mutual coexistence within African social structures. This was 
part of the shift towards the rapid growth in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which will be 
dealt with in the next chapter.

5 - Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade 
 
The Atlantic slave trade began in 1442 when African captives from the Senegal river were 
taken to the port of Lagos in southern Portugal and sold as slaves. After the Spanish reached 
the Americas in 1492, the direction of the trade became trans-Atlantic. The trade ended in 
1866, when the last voyage crossed the Atlantic Ocean to Cuba. 
The Atlantic slave trade was a significant part of the historical experience of West African 
peoples throughout this period. It influenced political change, religious practice, farm 
production, and other aspects of daily life. It was also a main cause of the growing European 
presence in West Africa; and it influenced the global connections which many West African 
rulers developed over the course of these four centuries. 
Most areas of West and West-Central Africa were influenced by the Atlantic slave trade in 
this period, as well as what is now Mozambique. There were many different phases of the 
Atlantic slave trade. Some of the most important were the following: 
 
1) 1442-1492: The first fifty years saw the trade almost solely from Senegambia to Portugal, 
Seville, and other ports in Spain and Portugal. 
2) 1492-1575: The Spanish arrival in the New World under Columbus saw the beginning of a 
change. In this era, the trade in enslaved persons remained quite low, as Europeans were 
more interested in gold. Most Africans going to the New World came from Senegambia, 
Guinea-Bissau, Guinea and Sierra Leone, often via the Cape Verde islands [which were a 
Portuguese colony already]. There was a growing trade from ports of Kongo and Angola, 
mainly to the sugar plantations which had been founded on the island of São Tomé. 
3) 1575-1640: In 1575, the Portuguese founded a colonial fort city at the harbour of Luanda, 
in Angola. This undermined the Kingdom of Kongo, since the major currency used in Kongo 
was the nzimbu shell, which was found at Luanda – by seizing Luanda, the Portuguese had in 
effect seized the bank of Kongo. Meantime, in Brazil, the number of sugar plantations near 
the colonial capital of Salvador da Bahia was growing, while the Native American population 
declined. This saw the volume of the slave trade increasing, especially from Angola; it also 
remained significant from the Greater Senegambia region, but was not yet important 
elsewhere in West Africa. 
4) 1640-1675: This was a very important period. It was in these decades when the Dutch, 
English and French began to compete in earnest with the Portuguese for the slave trade, 
opening their own fortress-factories, especially along the Gold Coast, at Calabar and Bonny 
in the Niger Delta, and further south at Loango. Meanwhile droughts in Senegambia and the 
effects of decades of war in Angola saw population declines there. By 1675, the old Brazilian 
connection to Angola was changing, and Brazilian traders in Salvador opened a direct 
trading link with the Yorubà and Ajà rulers around Hueda, Dahomey, and Lagos.

5) 1675-1700: This period saw the consolidation of the trade in these ports, and the 
expansion to areas which had hitherto been unimportant in the trade, especially Benguela 
in southern Angola and the Gold Coast [owing to the population decline around Luanda, 
Benguela had grown in importance for the Brazilians, and developed a direct link to Rio de 
Janeiro in the 18th century]. 
6) The long 18th century (c. 1700-1807). This was the century which saw by far the largest 
number of enslaved Africans taken in European and New World ships to the Americas. 
Almost every region of Atlantic Africa was affected. Areas which saw a particular expansion 
included Sierra Leone [shaped in part by the rise of the theocracy of Fuuta Jaalo in Guinea-
Conakry, and the slaving wars led by this polity]; the Gold Coast [influenced by the rise of 
the Asante empire in the 18th century, and the switch from gold exports to enslaved 
persons]; Loango [in what is now Congo-Brazzaville] and Benguela. 
7) The era of abolition (1807-1865). The British parliament passed an Act to Abolish the 
slave trade in 1807, though Denmark had been the first European nation to do this in 1792. 
However the 19th century was still very significant in the slave trade, with the major slave 
trading nations being from the New World, especially Brazil, Cuba, and the United States of 
America. The areas worst affected by this time were Angola and Mozambique. The loss of 
the South in the American civil war (1861-65) and pressure from England on Brazil saw the 
atmosphere change, and the slave trade ended in 1865 [Brazil had finally ceased direct slave 
trading in 1851].

Bonny, at the Bight of Biafra, on April 15th, 1822. She departed from Nantes, in France, and

cruisers before sailing to the Americas and taken to Freetown, Sierra Leone, 1822, Affaire

When considering this chronological overview of the slave trade, some important factors 
should be noted, though of course there are many others of great relevance: 
1) Historians have often emphasised what they call a “triangular trade”. Ships would leave 
Europe with textiles, manufactured goods made of copper and iron, cowries, alcohol and 
weapons; would sell these in Africa, and travel to the New World with a cargo of enslaved 
persons; and then exchange these for colonial produce (sugar, coffee, tobacco, etc.). 
However there was also often a direct trade from the Americas, especially from Brazil, Cuba, 
and the United States. 
2) The effects of the slave trade became especially important from around 1675 onwards. 
Until then, it was mainly Greater Senegambia that was affected in West Africa. 
3) Historians often disagree as to the impact of the slave trade on West African societies. 
Some aspects of history are worth noting, and were relevant to the slave trade, especially: 
:- Migration of communities to better-defended areas such as hilltops, forests, creeks 
:- Development of buildings and town designs which saw good defences and a maze of 
streets; this made it hard for hostile outsiders to find their way out. 
:- Formation of powerful armies and states; this was also the case of course in Europe, 
where the growth of organised armies and states also depended on economies connected 
to the slave trade 
:- Changes in religious practice; some shrines required offerings of goods which could only 
be acquired through trade, and kings’ association with the trade and with shrines made 
people in some areas more willing to adopt other religions, such as Islam and Christianity. 
The www.slavevoyages.org database 
 
The www.slavevoyages.org database is a powerful tool for historians who want to 
understand the quantities of Africans forcibly embarked on slave ships by Europeans. 
Historians have been systematically collecting evidence on the trans-Atlantic slave trade 
since the 1960s. Computing technology enabled them to gather and compare data for 
different aspects of the slave trade more easily. An international team of historians decided 
to create www.slavevoyages.org, a database giving details about each voyage recorded in 
newspapers, trade ledgers, ships’ logs and the different sources still available at the end of 
the twentieth century and beginning of the twenty-first century. These sources are written 
in multiple languages and are disseminated over three continents. This collaborative 
database is constantly updated and remains a work in progress. 
This database is an excellent tool to analyse the number of slaves captured between 1514 
and 1866 and gives the estimate of around 12,500,000 Africans who embarked on slave 
ships. 
Volume and direction of the trans-Atlantic slave trade from all African to all American 
regions, www.slavevoyages.org 
The database is an excellent tool to learn about: 
• the number of Africans who died during the Middle Passage. The number of slaves 
who embarked on slave ships (around 12,500,000) is substantially larger than the 
number of Africans who arrived as slaves in America (around 10,700,000). Historians 
were able to conclude that mortality rates on slave ships were extremely high. 
• the number of enslaved Africans for every slaving voyage out of a total number of 
36,000. Details about the slaves themselves are sometimes vague and we rarely 
know their gender, age or names.

many voyages. As a result, historians are now able to analyse the fluctuations of the 
transatlantic slave trade year by year. 
• The seasonal patterns for the slave trade. Sailors followed precise patterns which 
corresponded to the navigation conditions of the Atlantic ocean but also to the 
supply of African coasts and demands of American ports.

inland.

determine the port where they sailed from. The database enables us to determine 
which traders, ports and countries benefited the most from this lucrative trade.

there were African riots on one ship out of ten. 
• the destination of the ships. Many sources mention where the slaves disembarked 
and were sold. It does not mean that the slaves could not be sold again after their 
arrival in America. 
However, the database has also been criticised: 
• The database does not give details about the nature of the slave trade itself. 
• Nor does it give the reasons behind the trans-Atlantic slave trade or the 
consequences it had on African societies. 
• In many cases, the data is not accurate and some researchers have found notable 
differences with the original documents which contained the data. 
• In addition, some historians criticise the database for reproducing the ideas of the 
slave traders themselves, in treating slaves as statistics, and because the documents 
used to produce it were all written by slave traders. 
West African Resistance to the Slave Trade 
 
One of major factors that led to the abolition of the slave trade in West Africa was West 
African resistance. West Africans resisted slavery in four major ways: 
 
1. The resistance by everyday West Africans on West African soil 
2. The resistance of the West African ruling elite 
3. The resistance of West African abolitionists abroad 
4. Overt resistance by West African slaves en route to, and in, the New World 
 
1. Resistance by everyday West Africans on West African soil 
A number of West African people kept out of slave trade, refusing to negotiate with 
Europeans at all. For instance, the Jola of Casamance (Senegal), and the Baga (modern 
Guinea)—who were unbeatable in battle—did not participate in the slave trade. 
Other West Africans devised short and long-term mechanisms to resist the slave trade 
including: 
 
a) Resettling to hard-to-find places. 
In the Sokoto Caliphate (Nigeria), the landscape of mountains, caves, underground tunnels, 
and marshes was cleverly used by the inhabitants for protection. They reinforced these, by 
building ramparts, fortresses, other architectural devices, and planting poisonous thorny 
bushes and trees. The peoples of southern Togo, central and northern Cameroon used 
mountain ranges to hide away from slave traders. 
b) Building fortresses and fortifications to protect people against the slave trade. 
The people of Gwolu (Ghana) built a protective wall to guard against slave raiders. Their 
Paramount Chief Koro Liman IV describes the walls: 
I am standing in front of the inner wall of the Gwolu protective wall, which protected the 
great Gwolu from slave raiders and encroachments into Gwolu city in ancient times. We 
have two walls and this is the inner wall. 
In ancient times when slavery was rampant, our great, great, ancestor King Tanja Musa built 
the wall to ward away slave raiders and slave traders from coming into Gwolu to enslave our 
people. 
The reason we have the inner and outer wall is that between the two walls we had ponds 
and farms, so that the inhabitants would be protected from being kidnapped by slave 
raiders. 
First, there was only the inner wall. Then they realized that people who went to farm, find 
firewood, and fetch water were kidnapped by slave raiders. The king found it necessary to 
construct a second wall and that is why it is a two-walled city. And I know that in the whole 
of Ghana there are only two such walls. 
c) Evolving new, more rigid styles of leadership. 
The Kayor and Baol of Senegal aristocracy utilized mechanisms of domination and 
submission for their own protection by imposing new forms of habitat and land occupancy 
which functioned to shield the powerful. 
d) Transforming the habitat and the manner in which land is occupied. 
In Ganvié city (Dahomey), people built small towns on stilts on the edge or middle of Lake 
Nokoué. This allowed them to see approaching raiders. The city of 3,000 homes, was 
founded in the 16th century by Tofinu people. In the Tofinu language, Ganvié means, “we 
are saved.” The people built it as a refuge from Dahomey kingdom slave raiders. The lake 
was too shallow for European slave ships to anchor, and religious custom prevented the Fon 
of Dahomey from venturing across water to capture them. 
The Musugu of Southern Lake Chad built dome-shaped houses, with material made of clay 
mixed with animal dung, dry grass, and water. These dome shaped houses, when seen from 
afar, looked like termite nests and created a camouflage from the slave raiders. 
e) The creation of maroon societies in the Upper Guinea Coast. 
f) Secret societies, women’s organizations, and young men’s militia redirected their 
activities toward the protection and defense of communities. 
In Igboland, Nigeria, for instance, Olaudah Equiano indicates that he had undergone military 
training, including shooting and throwing javelins in order to become a member of local 
militia. 
g) Children were turned into sentinels throughout West Africa. 
h) Venomous plants and insects were turned into allies. 
In northern Cameroon and Chad for instance, fences were created from branches of thorny 
and poisonous trees, and these provided effective defense against slave raiders. The people 
also used thorny plants to reinforce the rock walls. 
The peoples of present-day Chad Republic adopted new agricultural methods to fight the 
slave trade. They stopped planting millet and sorghum which made them particularly 
vulnerable to slave raiders because these were grown in large cleared fields, visible to 
passersby, and signaling the presence of farmers. Moreover, the crops demanded 
considerable care during growing season. Thus, the people stopped growing sorghum, 
relying more on hunting and gathering. They also started cultivating manioc or cassava. 
Manioc was particularly well suited, because the tubers were buried deep within the 
grounds, the foliage could be chopped off, thus requiring little or no attention. 
i) Priests created spiritual protections for individuals and communities. 
This happened throughout Igboland, Nigeria. For instance, the Idoha community of Nsukka, 
eastern Nigeria, created the Efuru goddess who served to protect the community against 
the actions of slave raiders. 
j) Resources were pooled to redeem those who had been captured and held in factories 
along coast. People of the Futa Jallon (Guinea’s northern border with Senegal) were known 
to have adopted this strategy. 
k) Individuals and states traded people to access guns and iron for better weapons to 
protect themselves. For instance, the Balanta of Guinea Bissau defended themselves by 
producing and selling their captives in order to obtain guns and iron bars which they needed 
to forge powerful weapons and tools. 
l) Some free people attacked ships and burnt down factories. 
For instance, in the 17th and 18th century, written records document at least 61 attacks on 
ships by land-based West Africans. There were several conspiracies, and actual revolts by 
captives which erupted in Goree Island. One such revolt, resulted in death of governor and 
several solders. 
When all else failed, men and women revolted in barracoons and aboard ships. In Sierra 
Leone, for instance, people sacked the captives’ quarters of slave trader John Ormond; and 
the level of the fortification of forts and barracoons attests to European distrust and 
apprehension. 
West Africans also revolted on slave ships. Crews of several slave ships were killed in the 
Gambia River, while many enslaved West Africans either jumped overboard or let 
themselves starve to death. 
 
2. Resistance of African ruling elite 
a) In the 1530s, the King or Oba of Benin saw that slave trafficking was draining his 
kingdom of male manpower. He therefore banned sale of slaves, but, kept domestic slaves. 
By 1550, there was no slave trade in Benin. Pepper and elephant tusks became the main 
exports. Even up to the 17th century, the Kings of Benin still refused to cooperate with 
European slavers. 
b) In 1670, King Tezifon of Allada rejected French request for permission to establish a 
trading post in his territory. Hear his clear-sighted statement: 
 
You will make a house in which you will put at first two little pieces of cannon, the next year 
you will mount four, and in a little time your factory will metamorphosed into a fort that will 
make you master of my dominions and enable you to give laws to me. 
c) The 1670s Muslim leader and reformer, Nasr al-Din, denounced slavery to the people 
of Senegal. This resulted in Marabout war and the Toubenan movement (from word tuub, 
meaning to convert to Islam), whereby the sale of slaves to Christians was banned, thus, 
undermining the French trade in slaves. 
d) In 1724, King Agaja of Dahomey attacked his Ouidah and Ardrah neighbors to stop 
trade in slaves. 
e) In 1787, the Almamy of Futa Toro forbade the passage of slaves for sale through his 
domain. At the time, several French ships were waiting in anchor in Senegal for slaves to 
board. The French, as result, were not able to fill ships with human beings. They thus sent 
presents to the Almamy to appeal to him to rescind his order. The Almamy returned all gifts 
presented to him, declaring that all the riches of the Senegal company would not divert him 
from his design. Traders therefore had to stay away from Almamy’s vicinity on Senegal River 
and look for another route to coast. 
 
3. Resistance of West African Abolitionists Abroad 
Many West African abolitionists were campaigning against the slave trade in Britain or in the 
Americas. As freed slaves, their personal experience leant poignancy to their arguments. 
Two ex-West African slaves, Oladauh Equiano and Ottobah Cugaono, were involved in the 
18th century abolitionist movement in England. Both wrote books in 1780s publicizing the 
evils of the slave trade. 
Quobna Ottobah Cugoano (John Stuart), was a Fante, born in present day Ghana, and 
captured at age of 13. He wrote, Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of 
the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Humbly Submitted to the Inhabitants of 
Great Britain by Ottobah Cugoano, a Native of Africa. The book was published in 1787. In it, 
he argued eloquently and passionately for an immediate end to slave-owning and trading. 
. . . kings are the minister of God, to do justice, and not to bear the sword in vain, but 
revenge wrath upon them that do evil. But if they do not in such a case as this, the cruel 
oppressions of thousands, and the blood of the murdered Africans who are slain by the 
sword of cruel avarice, must rest upon their own guilty heads. 
He also proposed that the British naval squadron should patrol the West African waters in 
order to suppress the trade. It would take the British another 30 years before Cugaono’s 
idea was put into practice. 
Olaudah Equiano (Gustavus Vassa) was an Igbo of eastern Nigeria. His first name Olu uda, 
means, loud voice, and his surname Equiano is a short form of Ekwe anyi ino (someone who 
does not agree to stay). Equiano’s family was from Essaka, Iseke in present-day Olu Division, 
Igboland. He published a bestseller in which he offers a vivid and detailed account of his life 
from early childhood to enslavement. The Interesting Narrative of the life of Oluadah 
Equiano or Gustavus Vassa the African was published in 1789. 
This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration, from 
a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many 
died, thus falling victims to the improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their purchasers. This 
wretched situation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains, now become 
insupportable; and the filth of the necessary tubs, into which the children often fell, and 
were almost suffocated. The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered 
the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable.

4. Overt resistance by West African slaves en route to, and in the New World 
Revolts aboard ships were common. Therefore, sailors had to be heavily armed and 
constantly on guard. Once in the Americas and Caribbean Islands, West Africans resisted 
their bondage. They seized every opportunity to escape. Some formed maroon societies, 
including the biggest maroon society of all, Palmares, in Brazil. 
During the Haitian Revolution of 1791 in St Domingue (Haiti), over 400,000 enslaved 
Africans rose up against, and killed, their white French masters to establish the Republic of 
Haiti in 1804. They were led by Toussaint L’Ouverture who originally hailed from West 
Africa. 
 
Haitian Revolution - Battle of San Domingo, also known as the Battle for Palm Tree Hill, by 
January Suchodolski (1844). 
In mainland North America, there were a number of prominent revolts as well, including, 
the 1831 Nat Turner Revolt and the treks to freedom led by Harriet Tubman and her 
Underground Railroad. 
 
Reparations to Subjugated Societies 
Reparation is an idea that seeks for compensatory payment to suppressed group of people 
in a society. Most societies across the globe had fell victim of some sort of subjugation from 
more powerful societies/class. One can talk of situations like Colonialism, the Jewish 
Holocaust in the Second World War, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade (TAST) among others. 
After the Suppressed have been able to liberate themselves from the shackles of such 
conditions, there is always a quest for reparation. This form of reparation can be in kind or 
materialistic. The most known and controversial of them of is the reparation for slavery in 
Africa; the argument is that some form of compensatory payment needs to be made to the 
descendants of Africans who had been enslaved as part of the TAST. 
The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade which led to displacement of Africans into the New World 
had commoditized humans rather than other trading items like gold and ivory among others 
as goods. Africans were taken by European merchants across the Atlantic Ocean after the 
discovery of the New World to provide the needed labour power in plantations. This trade 
had devastated African society at home and in the diaspora as well. African slaves were 
obtained through warfare, kidnapping and as sale product from the market among other 
sources. These slaves suffered severe conditions through the Middle passage, on the 
plantation system and psychological trauma after emancipation. It is based on these 
injustice against slaves and their descendants in the Americas that African-Americans and 
members of the Caribbean diaspora are increasingly questing for reparation. 
 
WHO SHOULD BE COMPENSATED IN RELATION TO THE TAST? 
Reparation for harm caused Africans both home and the diaspora as the result of the slave 
trade need to be considered with care. Because, the slaves suffered all sort of humiliation in 
the plantation system and subsequent segregation policies directed toward them, 
particularly in the United States, Brazil, and in the Caribbean. The nature of slavery in the 
New World disallowed slaves to own property. As a result, life after the emancipation was 
almost as the same as living in slavery. In line with this, the descendants of the former slaves 
in the diaspora need to be compensated sufficiently in order for them to rehabilitate 
themselves, especially as to this day they suffer the economic and social consequences of 
the enslavement of their ancestors, through the prison system, inequality of access to 
healthcare and education, and relative poverty compared to those not descended from the 
enslaved. 
Also, Africans at home equally suffered the consequences of the slave trade and need 
reparation as well. 
· For instance, resourceful human power was taken away to the New World to the 
detriment of the homeland. This extracted valuable labour power which could have gone in 
to developing African economic systems, and contributed to economic disempowerment. 
· The desire for slaves by the Europeans plugged the continent into war, as guns and gun 
powder was introduced to the indigenous Africans to wage war against one another. This 
had led to displacement of people and loss of life and property. It also helped to create a 
predatory state model which may influence some modern problems in the continent. 
Henceforth, reparation for the slavery needs to encompass both the homeland and the 
diaspora. 
 
FORMS OF REPARATION FOR THE SLAVERY 
Compensation through Money: The former slaves in the New World especially in the US 
demanded some sort of money after the liberation in order to alleviate themselves to a 
better condition. 
Compensation through Housing: The slaves after being liberated were stranded. No place to 
live, hence, they demanded provision of housing facilities to accommodate themselves. 
Compensation in Kind: Various countries and institutions have apologised for their 
involvement on the deadly slave trade across the Atlantic Ocean. On June 18, 2009, the 
Senate of the US passed a resolution apologizing for the institution of slavery and all sort of 
discrimination against the Black race. 
Nevertheless, reparations have not been fully granted, and not all slave trading nations have 
apologised for the slave trade. Questions to be resolved may include: 
:- Who will make payments – direct descendants of known slave traders, or the states which 
allowed the slave trade? 
:- Who will receive the payments – is it best for this money to be allocated according to class 
boundaries (which might prove longstanding effect of the slave trade) or to the 
governments of postcolonial states? 
:- What role might there be for companies who benefited from the slave trade, should they 
also be paying compensation? A good example would be the Tate & Lyle Sugar Company, 
derived from Caribbean sugar plantations who founded the Tate Museums in London.

6 - Christian Missionary Activities in West Africa 
 
The expansion of the missionary movement into Africa was part of the growing conception 
of Christian responsibility for the regeneration of African peoples. The anti-slavery issue and 
the humanitarian conscience also played a vital role in stimulating European interest in 
Africa and gave an impetus to mission work. It included the opening up of Africa to forces of 
change namely commerce (“legitimate commerce”, i.e. non-slave trade), Christianity, 
Civilization and Colonization. The others included the Christian responsibility for the 
regeneration of African peoples. 
The achievement of the purpose of these Christian Missions came with some costs. Several 
missionaries died at a youthful age due to the unfriendly tropical climate. Again, in West-
Africa, the efforts to go beyond the coast to reach those inland with the gospel coincided 
with the southwards expansion of Islam which posed some threat to the expansion of the 
work of Christian evangelizing missions. The work of the missionaries also had little success 
initially. The people received the message with indifference. It was however in the coastal 
territories filled with mulattos and other European trading communities that Christianity 
won some of its early success. 
The first Europeans arrived at the West-African Coasts at the end of the fifteenth century. 
For several years they paid attention to slave trade rather than evangelization and 
Christianization of the people of West-Africa. However, by the turn of the Nineteenth 
Century there was systematic efforts by churches of Christian Europe, namely: Anglicans, 
Methodists, and Baptists who were active in Sierra Leone and, with Presbyterians, in 
Nigeria, while Methodists also set up missions in Ghana, Gambia, and Dahomey. In the 
19thh century, too, Afro-Brazilians returned to Benin and Nigeria with Catholicism. 
A new era began with the settlements of Black Christians from Nova Scotia in Sierra Leone in 
1787 and the missionary advance inland from Cape Town beginning with the arrival there of 
J. T. van der Kemp in 1799. New missionary societies (the LMS, the CMS, the Holy Ghost 
Fathers, the White Fathers, etc.) began work in many parts of Africa. 
The CMS began to work in the freed slave villages in Sierra Leone in 1804 and the Methodist 
in 1811. The early success of the missionaries included areas like Freetown and surrounding 
villages. Some early success included the Liberian coast where Afro-Americans and freed 
slaves were converted. The others include the French trading posts at Grand Bassam (Ivory 
Coast), Assinie and Libreville in Gabon. 
Apart from the extreme south and the Horn, the interior was hardly touched by Europeans 
before the last quarter of the Nineteenth Century. At the end of the eighteenth century, the 
Evangelical Revival began to bring to Africa an influx of missionaries whose laoburs would 
produce the first fruits of an enduring Christian presence in Sub-Sahara Africa. 
In the later 19th century, the immense African interior remained the principal object of the 
Catholic Priests, and from 1867 until his death in November 1892 Cardinal Lavigerie planned 
the planting of churches in Africa South of the Sahara. It is important to emphasize that the 
modern history of the Christian Mission in Africa started from the late Eighteenth Century, 
the Catholics had been there earlier in the first centuries of the Christian era especially 
during the first Portuguese adventures. Therefore the period for the rise of Christianizing 
Missions in the late Nineteenth Century has been considered as reprise. The late Eighteenth 
Century witnessed the rise of Christian groups in Europe that resorted to the evangelization 
of Africa. For instance, on 2nd October 1792, the Baptist Missionary Society was formed 
followed by the interdenominational London Missionary Society which was established in 
1795. The others include the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804, which was tasked 
with the responsibility of promoting the translation and printing of the Holy Bible. Initially, a 
majority of the missionary journeys was done with English-Speaking Protestants and later, in 
the 1820s and 1830s, they were joined by continental Protestantism from Germany, 
Switzerland and France. There were related organizations that sprang up in Scandinavia, 
Holland and the USA. 
West Africa owes to the Christian missionaries not only a new religious faith which has 
changed the beliefs and life of millions of people, but also the foundation of western 
education. The Portuguese were the first to introduce the Christian faith into West Africa 
but following their departure from the West Coast in the mid-seventeenth century, the 
Christian religion survived only in Upper Guinea where a bishop was maintained in the Cape 
Verde Islands serving also a part of the mainland. It was not until the nineteenth century, 
that the new religion was really established in West Africa. 
In this chapter, we shall examine how Christianity and Western-style education influenced 
West Africans values, attitudes and life-styles. 
CHRISTIANITY IN THE FRENCH COLONIES 
As a predominantly Roman Catholic country, France encouraged Roman Catholic 
missionaries’ right from the start of her colonial activities in West Africa. The Church had its 
strongest hold in the Senegambia area. Unlike the Portuguese, the French colonial officials 
encouraged the Christian missionaries in the promotion of formal education and social 
services, notably health. In the field of education, however, the missionaries had to adjust 
their programmes to fit in with the policy of assimilation. 
 
EVANGELICAL MOVEMENTS AND MISSIONARY SOCIETIES IN THE ENGLISH COLONIES 
From the second half of the eighteenth century, a fervent wave of evangelical spirit 
developed in the United Kingdom, Europe and the New World which inspired men and 
women with the missionary fervour to found religious societies whose members would go 
out to Africa and the other lands. They were to spread the message of the Gospel, render 
social services to the people and to assist in the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. 
These new movements considered such ventures to be their contribution to Europe’s 
reparation for centuries of exploitation of Africans, reparation for the centuries of 
exploitation which the Trans Atlantic slave trade had caused to African society. 
Among the early Protestant evangelical societies founded in Great Britain were the Baptist 
Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the 
Wesleyan Missionary Society and what became known as the Presbyterian Missionary 
Society of the Church of Scotland. Similar organizations were formed in several other 
European countries. These included the Basel Missionary Society, founded in Switzerland, 
and the Breman Mission formed in Germany. The evangelical societies founded in the 
Americas included the Baptist Missionary Board and the Nova Scotian Methodists, whose 
members went to work among the Maroons, who had settled mainly in Liberia. 
While the protestant evangelical movements were gaining ground in West Africa, similar 
movements were being promoted by the Roman Catholic Church in Europe. With the 
support of the Propagation of the Faith within the Vatican, whose Cardinal Secretary 
became Pope Gregory XVI, various Roman Catholic missionary societies were founded. 
Among these were the Congregation of the Holy Ghost (commonly known as the Holy Ghost 
Father), the Society of African Missions (SMA), the Society of Missionaries of Africa, 
popularly known as the White Fathers because of the white Muslim-like clothing which the 
Fathers wore, and the society of the Divine Word (SVD, abbreviated from its Latin name). 
These missionary societies laid the foundations of the Roman Catholic Church in West 
Africa, which lasted through to the independence period when African clergy replaced the 
white pastors. 
 
Establishment of Christian Churches In The Gambia 
The vast majority of the people of The Gambia are Moslems; but a sizeable percentage of 
the population, especially in and around the capital Banjul, are Christians. Early missions 
conducted by Roman Catholics were short-lived. A new attempt to spread Christianity was 
made when the Church Missionary Society (CMS) arrived from Britain in 1821. They were 
followed in turn by the Methodists and the Roman Catholics. Within a short time the 
missionaries spread their activities inland. Barely ten years later, after the first missionaries 
arrived, the Methodists, for example, had started a station as far inland as MacCarthy 
Island. As happened in other territories, the Christian missionaries did not confine their 
work to the spread of the gospel alone. Besides education, they cared for the sick. Thus, as 
early as 1823, the Roman Catholic sisters started a clinic for the sick and for children in 
Banjul. 
Establishment of Christian Churches In Ghana 
After earlier unsuccessful attempts by the missionaries Chretien Proten, Henrick Huckuff 
and Jacobus Capitein, the Anglican, Rev. Thomas Thompson, arrived in Cape Coast in 1752. 
Among his pioneering achievements, he arranged for three youths to be sent to England for 
training as evangelists. One of them, Philip Quaque, returned in 1765 as an ordained priest. 
He worked zealously as an evangelist and schoolmaster in the Castle School until his death 
in 1816. His work, however, did not extend much beyond Cape Coast and the neighbouring 
area. 
Renewed evangelisation started when the Basel (later known as Presbyterian) missionaries 
started work at Osu (Accra). Soon after, in 1835 they moved up to Akropon on the hills in 
Akuapem, where the pioneer missionary the Rev. Andreas Riis, assisted by a team of West 
Indian evangelists, laid the foundations of the Basel Missionary Church in the country. 
 
Thomas Birch Freeman, Wikicommons. 
In the same year as the Basel missionaries settled in Akuapem 1835 the Wesleyan (later 
Methodist) Church was established at Cape Coast by the Rev. Joseph Dunwell. He was 
followed, three years afterwards, by the Rev. Thomas Birch Freeman, son of a London-based 
West Indian father and an English mother. He introduced the Methodist Church in Asante in 
1839, and won the support of the Asante king. 
In 1880, two Roman Catholic priests of the Society of African Missions (S.M.A.), Father 
Auguste Moreau and Father Eugene Murat, arrived at Elmina and revived the Roman 
Catholic Church in Ghana. The American Episcopal Evangelical (A.M.E.) Zion Church owes its 
foundation in Ghana to Bishop J. Bryan Small, who started work first at Keta in 1898. 
Establishment of Christian Churches In Nigeria 
In the days of Portuguese contacts with Nigeria, Catholic priests had established missionary 
stations in Benin and the neighbourhood. But despite the work of Portuguese missionaries 
based on the island of Sao Tome and later of Spanish missionaries in Benin, it was not until 
the nineteenth century that the Christian religion was firmly established in Nigeria. 
It started first among the Yoruba recaptives who had embraced the Christian faith while in 
Sierra Leone (freed from slave trading ships by the British Royal Naval Squadron), and who 
returned home between 1839 and 1845. The pastors of the Church Missionary Society, from 
Badagry and later from Sierra Leone, visited these Christian communities in Abeokuta and 
other towns. Among the first missionaries was the Rev. Henry Townsend who went from 
Sierra Leone to Badagry in 1842 in his company was the Rev Ajayi Crowther.

Success followed the efforts of the pioneer missionaries. C.M.S. churches were firmly 
established in several important towns, such as Abeokuta (1846), Lagos (1851), Ibadan 
(1853), and Oyo (1856). Next, branches of the C.M.S. church were founded in south-eastern 
Nigeria, the chief centres being Bonny and Brass. The effects of work done by Bishop Ajayi 
Crowther, assisted by the Igbo recaptive the Rev. J. C. Taylor, in these parts of southern 
Nigeria can still be seen today. 
Other missionaries opened mission stations in the country. These included the Baptist 
missionaries who under the American evangelist, Thomas Bowen, started work from 
Ogbomosho in 1855. About the same time, the Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) headed by 
the Rev. Hope Waddell started pioneering work, in 1846, in Calabar. Hope Waddell was later 
joined by the Rev. Hugh Goldie and William Anderson. Another missionary whose memory is 
revered in Nigeria was Mary Slessor, she arrived in the country in 1876, and for many years 
worked assiduously as a missionary nurse. She succeeded in stopping the killing of twins in 
the areas where she served. 
The story of the planting of Christianity in Nigeria would be incomplete without a mention 
of the Italian Roman Catholic priest, Father Berghero. Operating from Whydah in what is 
today the People’s Republic of Benin (formerly Dahomey), Father Berghero, in 1860, visited 
Abeokuta and Lagos where freed Catholic slaves from Brazil welcomed him warmly. A 
permanent station was established in Lagos in 1868, soon followed by others at Lokoja, 
Abeokuta and Ibadan. Within ten years of Father Berghero’s visit, the Roman Catholic 
Church in Nigeria had become so well established that it ceased to be under administration 
from Dahomey. By 1885, the church had spread further inland, thanks to Father Joseph Lutz 
who started work around Onitsha in 1886 and spread the gospel in many parts of the 
present day Imo and Anambra States. Another important Catholic missionary in this area 
was the Irishman, Bishop Shanahan. 
Although Lokoja had a small C.M.S. station in 1858, it was not until 1889 that the 
missionaries entered Hausaland, which was predominantly Muslim. Their converts, for many 
years, were confined to the people of southern Nigerian extraction resident in the north, 
and to the-large non-Muslim population of the north. 
Establishment of Christian Churches In Sierra Leone 
In Sierra Leone, the Church Missionary Society (CMS), offshoot of the Anglican Church, was 
the first to become firmly established chiefly among the freed – captive and freed – slave 
settlers from Britain, Nova Scotia and other parts of the New World. They were followed by 
other major missionary bodies, including the Methodists and the Roman Catholics. As they 
could not recruit British missionary volunteers initially, the Church Missionary Society 
sponsored the services of German missionaries, who were Lutherans, to come out to Sierra 
Leone. The first batch, who came out between 1804 and 1806, included pioneer 
missionaries like Renner and Nylander. Another important German missionary was Wilhelm 
Johannson, better known by the English version of his name, William Johnson, who is 
revered in the history of the CMS in West Africa. 
The Methodists, known as the Wesleyan Missionaries (after their founder), arrived in 
Freetown in 1811. Their converts increased steadily in numbers until 1821 when a section 
broke away to form the first independent African, Christian church in West Africa, called 
the West Africa Methodist Church. In spite of the division, the parent Methodist missionary 
church played an important role in the history of Christianity in Sierra Leone. The next major 
Christian missionaries to go out to Sierra Leone were the Roman Catholics. After an 
unsuccessful beginning by the society of African Missions (SMA), this missionary body 
moved into other territories in what is now Liberia, Ghana and Nigeria. They were replaced 
in Sierra Leone by the Holy Ghost Fathers in 1864, who made converts in large numbers not 
only among the ‘pagans’ but also among the members of the then competing Christian 
churches. Like the Methodists, the Roman Catholic missionaries spread the faith notably in 
the interior, which later became Protectorate. 
CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY TO WEST AFRICA 
The impact of Christianity on West African society has persisted to this day. While it has 
brought undoubted benefits, it has also harmed the traditional way of life. 
The blessings which Christianity has brought to West Africa are many. Apart from giving to 
the converts a new religious faith which they consider is superior to the traditional religions, 
the Christian missionaries did pioneering work in introducing new crafts, industries, Western 
education and modern health services. 
1. BELIEF IN GOD 
The Christian religion teaches the doctrine of one supreme God and is opposed to the 
worship of any other forms of deity. Its message was that of love and the universal 
brotherhood of mankind. In this respect the Christian religion therefore differed from the 
traditional religions of West Africa, which along with an acceptance of one Supreme Being 
worshipped a hierarchy of gods. 
2. TERMINATING OBNOXIOUS PRACTICES 
Some of the traditional religious beliefs advocated certain practices such as human 
sacrifice and the killing of twins whose birth was regarded as an evil omen. 
Christianity stood firm against such evil practices. 
3. THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES AND VOCATIONAL SKILLS 
Without denying that prior to the introduction of Christianity in West Africa the people had 
developed their own crafts, one must admit that it was Christian missionaries who 
introduced modern forms of crafts such as carpentry and masonry. The early missionaries 
set up craft centres as part of their educational programmes. Also the missionaries set up 
model farms where scientific agriculture was taught and new crops were introduced for the 
people, to go alongside longstanding indigenous production. A notable example, in Ghana, 
was the Methodist experimental farm near Cape Coast whose crops included cotton, coffee, 
black pepper, mango, ginger, cinnamon and olive trees. 
4. THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES AND VERNACULAR LITERATURE 
Another valuable contribution of the Christian missionaries in West Africa was the 
development of literature in the local vernaculars, this included the translation of the Bible 
into some of the important local languages. 
In Ghana the Presbyterians were pioneers in reducing Ga and Twi into writing. In 1858 the 
Rev. Johannes Zimmermann wrote a grammar of the Ga language, and in 1874 the Rev. J. G. 
Christaller produced a Twi Grammar and Dictionary. In Fanteland, the Methodists and 
Roman Catholics pioneered similar works. While the Evangelical Presbyterian missionaries 
were the First to develop literature in Ewe, the Roman Catholics were responsible for Nzima 
literature. 
In Nigeria, one of the lasting works of the C.M.S missionaries was the development of 
literature in Yoruba. Among several others, the native Bishop Ajayi Crowther produced the 
first translation of the Bible in Yoruba. In 1859, the first newspaper in Yoruba, called the 
Iwe-Irohim, was published by the missionaries. Similar developments were carried out by 
the missionaries in other Nigerian languages, Efik, Kanuri, Igbo, etc. 
In the Gambia, the Methodist missionary and first principal of what later became known as 
the Gambia High School, the Rev. James Fieldhouse, produced a Wolof Grammar in 1876. 
5. HEALTH SERVICES 
The missionaries also greatly improved the health services. Prior to advent of the Christian 
missionaries and indeed well into the pre-independence period, most sick people depended 
for cure upon concoction herbs and roots and barks of trees. Although modern scientific 
research has confirmed the medicinal properties of these concoctions, traditional medical 
practice had several shortcomings. 
Preventive medicine was hardly known; the result was that epidemics of different kinds 
were frequent. Also, the traditional doctors more often than not could not diagnose illness 
accurately. They often attributed natural ailments to supernatural causes and resorted to 
mystic cults to appease the ‘unknown’ spirit, before applying medicine to the sick person. 
They also prescribed many taboos which, in the light of modern medical science, had no 
relation whatever with the illness being treated. 
However, the early missionaries established medical centres, at first at their mission posts, 
and later far and wide, to attend to the sick. In due course leprosariums and orphanages 
were built to supplement their medical services. 
For instance, in Nigeria, one of the first groups of missionaries to introduce organised 
medical services were the Roman Catholics. Father Jean Marie Coquard, operating in and 
from Abeokuta for forty years, was renowned among the Egba as a priest and surgeon in the 
second half of the nineteenth century. In 1892, the Church Missionary Society opened the 
Iyi Enu Hospital in Onitsha which is today a leading hospital in Anambra state. In 1902 the 
Methodists opened a clinic at Igbo-Ora. Meanwhile, the Scottish missionary, Mary Slessor, 
had established a reputation in the Cross River area as a nurse. Through hard work and 
persuasion she succeeded in stopping the practice among the people of killing twins. 
Another important missionary doctor was J. R. Stephen who for many years headed a 
missionary hospital at Ilesha. As happened in other West African countries, many more 
mission-sponsored hospitals were founded in the course of the twentieth century. 
Also, Christian missionaries in Ghana were as zealous as their counterparts in Nigeria in 
pioneering medical services. The Roman Catholic Sisters provided medical care in the Upper 
and Northern Regions of the country before the government started to provide hospitals 
and clinics in the regional and district headquarters. In the Western Region, the Catholic 
Sisters running a hospital at Eikwe specialized in maternity cases, and like Slessor in Nigeria 
succeeded in stamping out the practice of killing twins at birth. Other Roman Catholic 
hospitals were built in all the nine regions of the country; including those at Asikuma and 
Foso (Central Region), Akyem Swedru (Eastern Region), Berekum (BrongAhafo), Maase 
(Asante Region) and Anfoega (Volta Region). The Presbyterians, also, opened hospitals in 
several parts of the country, including the one at Agogo in Asante-Akyem. Among other 
missionary hospitals of long standing and reputation are those run by the Methodists at 
Wenkyi in the Brong-Ahafo Region, and by the Seventh Day Adventists at Kwahu Atibie in 
the Eastern Region. 
6. SUPPRESSED SLAVE TRADE 
Christian missions also took a leading role in the campaign to end the slave trade and to 
suppress slavery. 
7. EDUCATION 
Perhaps the greatest service of the missionaries was the promotion of western education 
and the development of vernacular literature. 
Until almost the end of the colonial period education was still largely in the hands of the 
churches. It was only after the Second World War that the colonial governments started to 
show a real interest in the promotion of formal education in West Africa. 
Development of Education in Sierra Leone 
In Sierra Leone, among the earliest higher institutions which the C.M.S. opened was the 
Christian Institute, established in 1814 for the training of teachers, catechists and priests. In 
1827 it grew into Fourah Bay College. In 1876 the college became associated with Durham 
University in England, which awarded degrees to students of the college. This special 
relationship continued until 1960 when Fourah Bay became a college of the newly 
reconstituted University of Sierra Leone; the other constituent college located at Njala 
developed from a training college founded in 1920. 
In 1845 the C.M.S. opened, in Freetown, the first boys’ secondary school in the country and 
another for girls in 1849, later renamed the Annie Walsh Memorial School. 
The Methodists founded the Boys’ High School in 1874, and another high school for girls six 
years later. 
The lead was followed by other missionaries, notably the Roman Catholic, whose first higher 
institution was St Edward’s Secondary School in Freetown. 
Secondary Schools in the Protectorate started later, following the establishment of Bo 
Government Secondary School in 1906. 
In 1950 Albert Academy was founded in Freetown; for-a long lime it was the secondary 
school in the Colony serving largely children from the provinces, among them were the 
future heads of state, Sir Milton Margai and Dr. Siaka Stevens. 
Development of Education in Ghana 
As happened in other colonial territories, the government did not show great interest in the 
provision of education in Ghana until the missionaries had extended their services 
throughout the country and had set up primary schools and a few secondary schools and 
training colleges. 
Up to Guggisberg’s time, the church schools did not receive grants from the government. 
Public money was spent only on the small number of government schools, totaling nineteen 
when Governor Guggisberg assumed office in 1919. In 1925 the Governor introduced 
measures which helped the efforts of the missionaries. Among other things the regulations 
required that all teachers should be registered, and a minimum salary was fixed. The 
government gave grants according to the strength of the staff and the efficiency of the 
school judged by inspection reports and the results of public examinations. 
Before 1925, there were only three secondary schools and three teacher training colleges in 
Ghana. All the three secondary schools in Cape Coast were mission institutions. The 
Methodists founded Mfantsipim (1876) for boys and Wesley Girls’ High School (1884). The 
third, St Nicholas Grammar School (now Adisadel College), was founded by the Anglican 
Church in 1910. The Roman Catholics established their first secondary school, St 
Augustine’s, at Cape Coast in 1936. Two important private schools with strong Christian 
influence must also be mentioned: Accra High School, founded in 1923 and Accra Academy, 
established in 
1931. 
Teacher training colleges in Ghana did not expand as fast as the secondary schools. 
Nevertheless, the first higher institution in Ghana, now the Presbyterian Training College at 
Akuapem Akropon, was established in 1848, first as a centre for training catechists, and 
later to train teachers as well as ministers of the Presbyterian Church. In 1858 ten years 
after the founding of the first college, the Presbyterians opened a sister college at Aburi for 
the training of women teachers. It was not until 1909 that the government opened a 
teacher training college and a technical school in Accra. The training college later became 
part of Achimota College. Two other training colleges opened by the missionaries, in the 
early days, were the Wesley College in Kumasi (1922) and the Roman Catholic Training 
College at Amisano, near Elmina (1931) which in 1936 moved to the campus of the newly 
founded secondary school, St Augustine’s College at Cape Coast. 
Development of Education in Nigeria 
The first school in Nigeria was started by the Methodist missionaries at Badagry in 1842. 
This was the work of the great missionary, Thomas Birch Freeman, who placed two 
missionaries, Mr and Mrs. de Graft, in charge of the school. Soon after the Methodist 
experiment, the church Missionary Society set up their own school at Badagry. 
These pioneer mission schools met with a discouraging response. They were closed down in 
1852 in favour of schools opened in Lagos which, in 1851, had one time British control. 
Earlier in 1846, the Rev. Hope Waddell of the Church of Scotland had opened a school at 
Duke Town, Calabar. Within ten years the C.M.S had opened twelve more schools in what is 
today Cross Rivers State. By the close of the nineteenth century the major Christian 
missionary churches had opened elementary schools in many part of southern Nigeria with 
an enrolment of about 74,000 by the First World War. 
Soon after the start of elementary schools, the missionaries started opening higher 
institutions also. Important among these, all in Lagos, were the Baptist Academy in 1855, 
the C.M.S. Grammar School for Boys in 1859, St Gregory’s College opened by the Catholics 
in 1876, Methodist Boys High School 1878 and Methodist Girls’ High School 1879. Soon after 
secondary schools were opened in other parts of southern Nigeria, including Bonny High 
School, which was taken over by government in 1904. 
To supplement these missionary efforts in the field of higher education, the government 
opened its own secondary school in Lagos in 1909, this was King’s College. Following 
agitation by the people in 1934, the government opened the old Yaba Higher College and 
Medical School, which awarded diplomas acceptable only locally. This instruction in 1948 
developed into the University College in Ibadan. The original Yaba College in Lagos has 
grown into a polytechnic. 
Predominantly Muslim territory, the North received western education later than the South. 
By 1914 there were barely thirty schools in that vast area. 
As happened in Ghana, the development of training colleges in Nigeria was slower than 
secondary schools, though the C. M. S. had opened the first training college at Abeokuta as 
far back as 1849. 
Development of Education In The Gambia 
In the Gambia, as happened in other territories, the Christian missionaries did not confine 
their work to the spread of the Gospel alone. Besides education, they cared for the sick. 
Thus as early as 1823, the Roman Catholic Sisters started a clinic for the sick and for children 
in Banjul. The churches opened primary schools both in the capital and in the rural 
communities. Their greatest legacy in the field of education was the foundation which the 
Methodist laid for what is today the Gambia High school. 
PROBLEMS FACED BY THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES 
The early European Christian missionaries in West Africa experienced a number of 
difficulties, some arising from factors outside their control and others of their own making. 
1. Unsuitable Climatic Conditions 
The tropical climatic condition in the country was not favourable to the early missionaries 
who came to the shores of West Africa. The high temperatures coupled with high rainfall 
patterns in some parts of the country experienced during the daytime, made the 
missionaries stay indoors, which slowed down their activities. 
 
2. Language Barrier 
Other difficulties they faced were the problems of the many languages and dialects and 
their ignorance of the true meaning of the various cultures, beliefs, values and ways of life 
of the people whom they set out to convert to Christianity. For the West Africans, the 
acceptance of Christianity meant the total rejection of most of the cherished institutions 
upon which their society rested. 
3. Misconception by the early Europeans 
The problems created by the white missionaries themselves arose largely from a 
misconception of what Africa represented. Europe in those days looked upon Africa as ‘the 
Dark Continent’ with very primitive civilizations, and most Europeans refused to adapt their 
religion to suit the local situation. And yet this was what earlier missionaries in pagan 
Europe had done when, for example, they had changed the Sabbath to suit the pagan Sun 
Day (hence Sunday), and had also adopted the dates of the pagan festivals to celebrate 
Christmas Day and the Easter festival. 
4. Despised African Culture 
The early African converts to Christianity, were made to abandon their ancestral culture and 
way of life as ‘pagan’ therefore to be shunned. Indeed, in some situations the converts were 
taught to feel that they were absolved from obeying their own traditional rulers and certain 
laws of the state. These trends occasionally brought kings into conflict with the missionaries 
and their converts. 
 
5. Health Problems 
 
The greatest problem faced by the early European Christian missionaries was, the tropical 
climate and health Hazards. Many missionaries died because of the climate and tropical 
disease. This single problem made the missionary work very difficult. However, the 
discovery of quinine and other curative medicines in the late 19th century made the history 
of the missionary work in West Africa a different thing altogether. 
 
6. Financial Problems 
 
Almost all the missions in West Africa faced financial problems in the early stages of their 
missionary work. They relied very much on their home churches for their funds. But the 
funds and other needed materials even when available could not reach their station in 
time. This was because all the ships that came to the coast at that time were owned by 
trading firms and companies whose interest were basically on trade. In such asituation, 
provisions and other things had to be sent into the country not in large quantities as would 
have been desired by the missionaries. 
 
7. Language Problems 
Other difficulties the early Christians faced were the problems of the many languages and 
dialects and their ignorance of the true meaning of the various cultures, beliefs, values and 
ways of life of the people whom they set out to convert to Christianity. It was difficult for 
the European missionaries to communicate freely with the local people. They had to speak 
through few interpreters who did not have sufficient education to interpret correctly. In 
such situations, the message sometimes appealed to the local people depending on the 
efficiency of the interpreter. Moreover, speaking through interpreters is a defective means 
of communicating one’s thoughts to one’s audience. 
 
8. Transportation Problems 
 
Lack of transport from the coast to the interior parts of West Africa was one of the major 
difficulties encountered by the missionaries. There were only bush paths, and no roads in 
the early times. Their luggage and other necessities had to be carried on heads and took a 
long time before reaching the missionaries. Besides, the missionaries had to travel longer 
distances to inland towns from their southern stations. 
 
9. Insufficient Christian Literature 
 
Another difficulty that the early missionaries faced in the spread of Christianity was 
insufficient Christian literature at that time. There were no Bibles in local languages, likewise 
grammar books were scant, so the missionaries had to spend time learning local languages, 
and translated the Bible and wrote series of grammar books. 
 
For instance, in Ghana, it was in 1858 that Rev. Johannes Zimmermann wrote a grammar of 
the Ga language and translated the entire Bible and a Bible history into Ga. Then in 1874, 
the Rev. John G. Christaller (described as the “Father of Twi Literature") produced a Twi 
grammar and dictionary, a collection of Twi proverbs, a Twi translation of the Bible as well 
as prayers and hymns. 
 
In Nigeria, one of the lasting works of the C.M.S. missionaries was the development of 
literature in Yoruba. Among several others, the native Bishop Ajayi Crowther produced the 
first translation of the Bible in Yoruba. In 1859, the first newspaper in Yoruba. Called the 
Iwe-Irohim, was published by the missionaries. Similar developments were carried out by 
the missionaries in other Nigerian languages, Efik, Kanuri, Igbo, etc. 
In the Gambia, the Methodist missionary and first principal of what later became known as 
the Gambia High School, the Rev. James Fieldhouse, produced a Wolof Grammar in 1876. 

10. Food 
 
Lastly, the missionaries were not used to eating our local foods. This made it difficult for the 
early missionaries to stay in the country for long. However, with time, they brought some 
crops, which they cultivated and which sustained them. 
 
EFFECTS OF CHRISTIANITY IN GHANA 
1. Damage of culture 
As an institution introduced by agents with radically different values, the Christian religion 
damaged the culture and traditional beliefs of the people of West Africa. Instead of adapting 
the teachings and practices of the ‘new’ religion to suit indigenous values, as it did when the 
same Christian religion adopted Greek, Roman, German and Anglo-Saxon native practices, 
the early Christian missionaries condemned totally as ‘pagan’, and to be avoided by their 
converts, whatever they considered strange. 
1. Harm to Traditional institution 
Being ignorant of the significance of certain institutions and practices of the people of West 
Africa, and occasionally being misled by their over-zealous followings into wrongly 
interpreting the people’s heritage, the missionaries compelled pupils in their schools and 
docile adult converts to shun their own ancestral practices. A notable example was the 
Asafo Company, a purely military and social organisation of the peoples of Ghana, which 
was condemned by the early missionaries because of its presumed connection with fetish 
practices. And yet the Asafo provided most of the services which a community needed: 
protection against military attacks, communal services, etc. 
• Adoption of Christian Names 
Christian converts were indoctrinated to frown upon the use of indigenous first names in 
favour of ‘Christian’ ones. Often drumming and the harmless songs and dances of the 
people were condemned. 
1. Superiority of western culture 
The education provided in schools in early days also tended to place great emphasis on the 
superiority of western culture. Textbooks were heavily biased towards western ideas and 
values. History books tended to exaggerate in achievements of Europeans, making no 
reference to African’s own great past. 
1. Creation of Salems 
Groundless fears that the converts would become contaminated with ‘paganism’ led some 
of the Christian missionaries, notably the Presbyterians, to separate the Christians from the 
rest of the township. 
1. Involvement in local political 
As happened in parts of Yorubaland in the last century, some of the Christian missionaries 
often engaged in local politics and took an active part in helping the colonial authorities in 
their wars of territorial expansion. 
In conclusion, the converts tended to look down upon many things in their ancestral culture. 
It would be wrong, however, to blame all these ills on the Christian missionaries alone. 
Some progressive Europeans, like the first principal of Achimota College, Rev. A.G. Frazer, 
did much to encourage the promotion of indigenous culture, but by and large the colonial 
authorities contributed to dwindling a good deal of our cultural heritage.

7 - Scramble for and Partition of West Africa 
 
1. The Scramble for Africa 
 
The Europeans had frequented the coasts of West Africa since the fifteenth century and 
established settlements along the coast in order to facilitate trade, in particular the 
transatlantic slave trade. There was, however, little interest in driving colonisation inland 
before the 1870s except in the Cape region (South Africa) and in Algeria that the French had 
turned into a settler colony, i.e. a colony where waves of European migrants often violently 
dispossessed the inhabitants of their lands. Forty years later, the situation would be 
radically different; in 1910, only Liberia and Ethiopia escaped European rule. What were the 
reasons behind Europe’s Scramble for Africa and why did it happen so rapidly at the end of 
the nineteenth century? 
 
• The Industrial Revolution 
 
Many historians and economists have argued that the colonisation of Africa was the direct 
consequence of the Industrial Revolution in Europe. During the nineteenth century, most 
European powers experienced a dramatic growth of productivity caused by a number of 
technical innovations such as steam engines, steel furnaces or electric power. It meant that 
European countries produced more goods than they could sell. They were constantly 
looking for new markets because the Europeans did not consume enough to absorb the vast 
quantity of products made possible by new manufacturing techniques. This is the theory of 
European under-consumption. 
This under-consumption led companies and states to look for trading opportunities around 
the planet. For them, the continent that they knew the least, Africa, needed to be open to 
trade. In exchange for tropical products in high demand in Europe, Africans would receive 
their manufactured products. The British, for example, wanted to obtain palm oil, cotton 
and rubber from the Gold Coast or groundnuts from the Gambia. Palm oil was used to 
create industrial lubricants, cotton to produce clothes, rubber to manufacture tyres and 
groundnuts were transformed into soap and wax. African products were thus at the centre 
of the Industrial Revolution. 
Powerful capitalistic interests were therefore among the reasons which pushed the 
Europeans to send expeditions along the rivers of Africa in the second half of the 
nineteenth-century. This explains why the colonisation of Africa was often driven by 
chartered companies, i.e. European private investors receiving privileges from their 
government to trade in territories outside of Europe. Some of these companies were 
instrumental in the creation of colonies as was the case for the Royal Niger Company in 
Nigeria. After years of transatlantic slave trade, industrialisation and what former slave 
trading European nations called “legitimate commerce” had thus become a strong motive 
reason for the European colonisation of the continent. This was then justified according to 
other pseudo-explanations, as we shall see below. 
 
• European Scientific Developments 
 
It could be argued that the Europeans could have invaded Africa before for the same 
commercial reasons. So why then did the colonisation of the continent take place at the end 
of the nineteenth century and not before? The reason might come from new technological 
developments of the Industrial Revolution. 
New weapons enabled the Europeans to conquer vast swathes of lands in a very short 
period of time whilst African societies did not have the tools to fight efficiently. The British 
army’s Martini-Henry breech-loading rifle could hit a target nearly a mile away, and could be 
fired 12 times a minute. The Maxim gun could fire 600 rounds a minute. In comparison, 
many Africans were fighting with single-shot muskets. Superior weaponry did not mean that 
many Africans were not able to defend themselves in a series of localised conflicts. Indeed 
many resisted European troops. For example, in modern-day Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali and 
Ivory Coast, Samori Ture fought against the French until his capture in 1898. The Asante in 
modern-day Ghana also chose to fight against the British to defend the Golden Stool. The

Other tools also facilitated the European invasion at the end of the nineteenth century. The 
steamboat and the telegraph accelerated the pace of the colonial conquest as faster travel 
and communication meant that European armies could easily distribute troops in different 
corners of Africa for short periods. Tropical diseases were brought under control by 
scientific discoveries. Before 1860, Europeans in West Africa were 75% likely to die within 2 
years, but the treatment of malaria with quinine saw the risk fall to 8% by 1900. 
 
• Humanitarianism and Racism 
 
Beyond material causes, the scramble for Africa required an ideological justification. The 
colonial conquest was based on the religious idea of a ‘mission’, the ethical idea of ‘ending 
slavery’, all inspired by racist ideas. 
After being responsible for the enslavement of more than twelve million Africans between 
the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Europeans ironically justified their African 
conquests in the name of the abolition of slavery. At the end of the nineteenth century, the 
slave trade became considered inhumane, and contrary to Christian values in the case of 
Britain and Republican values in the case of France. The 1889-90 Brussels anti-slavery 
conference perfectly illustrates this new vision of Africa where the Europeans considered 
themselves as the saviours of Africa – a vision which prefigures modern-day humanitarian 
interventions in Africa after natural or political upheavals. 
For the British, Civilisation, Commerce and Christianity (often known as the 3 Cs) were the 
main reasons behind colonialism. For secular France, it was the ‘civilising mission’. It had 
become a duty to bring peace to Africa to educate the Africans as they would be freed from 
the ills of war, disease and famine. 
According to racist theories developed in Europe by the end of the nineteenth century, 
Africans were supposed to belong to an inferior race which had to be enlightened by 
Europeans. This racist justification of colonialism was backed up by pseudo-scientific 
theories which situated Africans at the bottom of the racial hierarchy. Therefore, it was the 
‘white man’s burden’ to educate an inferior race. These theories materialised again as 
justification for Apartheid in South Africa. 
 
• European internal politics and rivalry 
 
Internal European politics might be responsible for the beginning of the Scramble for Africa. 
In 1870, newly-created Germany won a war against France. After this France tried to restore 
its national pride by competing with the Ottoman Empire and Italy for domination in North 
Africa and with the United Kingdom for commercial influence in West Africa. The new 
French colonial empire in West Africa presented an opportunity to show the strength and 
the values of the French Third Republic. 
For the British, the Suez Canal was a crucial bridgehead for the sea route leading to India. 
Egypt was officially under the control of the Ottoman Empire but was experiencing a series 
of political and economic upheavals in the 1870s. Afraid of losing control of such an 
important economic and strategic asset, the British invaded Egypt in 1882. For the British, 
the occupation of Egypt marked the transition between the period of informal empire, i.e. 
the period when empires dominated strategically or commercially non-European regions 
without claiming the territories as their own and high imperialism, i.e. the period when 
European powers invaded non-European territories. 
The rivalry between European powers was also one of the main drives behind the Scramble 
for Africa. In order to prevent each other from acquiring more territories, the Europeans 
carved up the African continent into colonies. Acquiring prestige by invading new territories 
was particularly important and the competition between the British and the French was 
responsible for the creation of most borders in West Africa. 
2. The Partition of West Africa 
 
Most African borders were created rapidly between c. 1900 and the end of the First World 
War by the Europeans. Why did it happen so quickly and how was West Africa partitioned? 
 
• African territories at the end of the nineteenth century 
 
Europeans imagined Africa as terra nullius: a vast land belonging to no none. Terra nullius 
was a legal invention of the Europeans to justify their encroachment on non-European 
lands. This was of course an absurdity which took no heed of the realities of complex African 
states and historical changes dating back to distant times. It was an invention of racist 
historians who knew nothing of Africa. 
During the nineteenth century, there were many well-organised states in West Africa. For 
example, following the jihad of Usman dan Fodio at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century, the Hausa-Fulanis created a caliphate which was the largest state in Africa at the 
time, and which had extensive textile industry and long distance trade. Meanwhile, the 
neighbouring kingdom of Borno was the heir of the sixteenth-century of the empire of 
Kanem-Borno, while in Guinea the Fuuta Jaalo state spread over a large area and conquered 
Kaabu’s longstanding empire in neighbouring Guinea-Bissau in the 1860s. 
While these larger states may have been the exception during the nineteenth century, 
smaller communities in West Africa also had a long history of trade and contact with the 
rest of the world. In the nineteenth century, West Africans lived in complex and varied 
political systems where authority could be exerted by men and women alike. 
 
• The African reaction to the arrival of European troops 
 
The difference between societies living in organised states and those living in non-
centralised polities might explain why African men and women reacted differently to the 
arrival of colonial troops. Historians have tried to explain why some of them chose to fight 
while the large majority of them did not make or were not offered the same choice. In 
societies with little tradition of centralised government, traditions of local autonomy made 
submission to a colonial empire inconceivable (for example, the relatively small 
communities living in the Niger Delta, Nigeria or the Bissagos Islands, Guinea-Bissau). 
Other larger societies in contact with the European for longer might have known the 
superior European firepower and accommodated themselves to the prospect of foreign rule 
accordingly; their subjects were also used to accommodating to political power, so the 
larger states were easier to conquer – as the Spanish had found in the Americas in the 
sixteenth century. 
Other societies were also profoundly divided and used the Europeans in their internal 
struggle. Africa like other continents was not a monolithic block and the idea of a 
continental-wide African resistance to colonialism would be anachronistic. Africans were 
thus divided when European troops conquered the continent. For example, the British 
became players in a civil war in Northern Nigeria and backed one side against the other. This 
was the pattern of divide and rule which had long been used by European imperialists, since 
the sixteenth century. In 1903, the conquest of Kano was thus undertaken with the help of 
its own inhabitants, just as the conquest of Mexico City by the Spanish had been undertaken 
with the help of Native American allies from Tlaxcala. 
 
• The military conquest of West Africa 
 
The conference of Berlin in 1884-85 set the rules for the partition of the whole of Africa. 
Strangely, it recognised the Congo Free State as the personal possession of Leopold II, the 
king of Belgium. Leopold II had been one of the instigators of the formal European land and 
power grab, and was personally rewarded for this role; the result would be the creation of 
one of the most inhumane of all the European colonial systems established in Africa. 
 
The Berlin Conference by Gartenlaube, 1884. Wikipedia. Public domain. 
Otherwise, the conference did not create borders in West Africa. Rather it allowed free 
navigation on the Congo and Niger Rivers. 
The conference of Berlin stipulated that in order to claim a colony in Africa, treaties needed 
to be signed with local rulers. The years following the conference of Berlin saw the 
multiplication of expeditions which aimed at signing treaties. However, these treaties were 
often misunderstood by local rulers who did not know that they would lose their authority. 
These were also expeditions backed by strong military force, which gave the rulers little 
choice other than to agree. 
To have their conquests recognised by the other colonial powers, the Europeans introduced 
the concept of effective occupation. Effective occupation meant that the Europeans needed 
to send troops to different corners of Africa to occupy ‘spheres of influence’. The concept of 
‘effective occupation’ resulted in a series of localised conflicts in West Africa which can be 
described as regional scrambles instead of a general Scramble for Africa. These regional 
scrambles unfolded rapidly between the conference of Berlin and the First World War. 
For example at the end of the nineteenth century, the Portuguese wanted to link their 
colonies of Angola and Mozambique across the continent. Their dream of a united empire 
was broken by the British businessman Cecil Rhodes who wanted to connect the British 
Cape Colony to Cairo and ultimately created the colonies of Southern and Northern 
Rhodesia. These opposing visions of empire could also be found in the Lake Chad area which 
was heavily disputed between France, Germany and the United Kingdom at the end of the 
nineteenth century. The three countries sent troops to the region and only reached a final 
agreement in 1902. 
Beyond these military escapades, the African participation to the European colonial 
conquest is significant. The continent was indeed conquered by European armies but most 
soldiers came from different regions of Africa. Centuries of the slave trade and the creation 
of powerful warrior aristocracies had created deep divisions. The Europeans were ready to 
exploit the internal divisions of the continent and recruited soldiers in their colonial 
possessions in order to invade and control their newly-conquered colonies. It was the classic 
imperial strategy of divide and rule. 
 
• The creation of boundaries 
Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913. CC BY-SA 4.0. Wikipedia. 
 
Africa was divided without consideration of local populations or pre-existing cultural groups. 
The result was that most African borders were the products of European geopolitical 
rivalries rather than West African history. This explains why most West African borders were 
created in European chancelleries and followed astronomical, mathematical or geographical 
lines (see factbox). 
It was not the first time that the Europeans created boundaries outside of Europe. In Latin 
America or South-East Asia, the Europeans had already created boundaries between their 
colonies. When African boundaries were negotiated in Europe, they were considered as part 
of a large-scale bargain for territories. The British and the French, for example, traded 
territories in West Africa (Los Islands in Guinea and upper Gambia), South-East Asia (rights 
to colonise territories surrounding Thailand), the Pacific (Vanuatu), and fishing rights in the 
Atlantic to seal their alliance called the Entente Cordiale in 1904. 
Most boundaries were created to satisfy the geopolitical ambitions of European diplomats 
who wanted to protect or affirm their respective spheres of influence. Rivers were 
considered especially worthy economic resources during this period, which explains how the 
borders of a colony such as Gambia were carved along the Gambia River. 
The Portuguese who had been present on the coasts of Africa since the fifteenth century 
played a particular role in the creation of borders. They collected and published numerous 
documents on the history of their possessions in order to justify their presence in Africa. 
Historical precedents were particularly sought after in a period where written documents 
were used as legal evidence. 
The border treaties signed between Europeans were often very vague and needed to be 
adapted on the ground. The lack of geographical knowledge of Africa on the part of the 
Europeans meant that precise borders needed to be delimitated with the help of African 
populations. So, at the scale of West Africa, most borders were traced in Europe but, at a 
local level, African populations could influence the creation of the colonial borders. This can 
be seen in the boundary between the Sokoto Caliphate and Borno which were used by the 
British and the French in their negotiations to separate Nigeria and Niger. 
After the defeat of Germany during the First World War, its West African colonies of Togo 
and Cameroun were divided between the British and the French under the aegis of the 
League of Nations. It was an opportunity for the Ewe populations of Togoland to be reunited 
with other Ewe speakers in the British colony of Gold Coast. The First World War was thus 
the last opportunity to redraw borders in West Africa. 
 
Conclusion: 
 
At the end of the nineteenth century, no one knew that colonial rule would last until the 
1950s in the case of Togo and Ghana, the 1960s for most other colonies in West Africa or 
the 1970s for the Spanish colony of Western Sahara or for the Portuguese colonies of 
Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde. For many Africans at the turn of the twentieth century, the 
European presence was only temporary. 
The Scramble for Africa had tremendous political, economic and cultural consequences for 
African men and women. Even if it lasted two or three generations, the colonisation of the 
continent had an enduring effect on African peoples and societies. 
At the moment of their creation, African borders were not conceived as rigid state 
boundaries but as administrative colonial limits. They have become the symbol of the 
colonial past for many twenty-first century Africans, who often call them the scars of 
colonisation. 
 
Factbox: 
In 2018, African borders are 83,500 kilometres (51,884 miles) long. Apart from the cases of 
Liberia and Ethiopia, most African borders were defined in Europe in a very short period of 
time between the end of the nineteenth century and the end of the First World War. Nearly 
44% of them were defined after astronomical lines (meridians and parallels), 30% after 
mathematical lines (arcs and lines) and 26% after geographic landmarks (mainly rivers and 
mountains). France is behind the creation of 32% of African borders, the United Kingdom 
26.8%, Germany 8.7%, Belgium 7.6%, Portugal 6.9%, the Ottoman Empire 4%, Italy 1.7% and 
Spain 1.5%.

8 - Colonial Rule in West Africa 
 
 The European scramble for Africa culminated in the Berlin West African Conference of 
1884-85. The conference was called by German Chancellor Bismarck and would set up the 
parameters for the eventual partition of Africa. European nations were summoned to 
discuss issues of free navigation along the Niger and Congo rivers and to settle new claims 
to African coasts. 
In the end, the European powers signed The Berlin Act (Treaty). This treaty set up rules for 
European occupation of African territories. The treaty stated that any European claim to any 
part of Africa, would only be recognized if it was effectively occupied. The Berlin Conference 
therefore set the stage for the eventual European military invasion and conquest of African 
continent. With the exception of Ethiopia and Liberia, the entire continent came under 
European colonial rule. The major colonial powers were Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, 
and Portugal. 
The story of West Africa after the Berlin Conference revolves around 5 major themes: the 
establishment of European colonies, the consolidation of political authority, the 
development of the colonies through forced labor, the cultural and economic 
transformation of West Africa, and West African Resistance. 
 
European Penetration and West African Resistance to Penetration 
Effective Occupation was a clause in the Berlin Treaty which gave Europe a blank check to 
use military force to occupy West African territories. 1885-1914 were the years of European 
conquest and amalgamations of pre-colonial states and societies into new states. European 
imperialists continued to pursue their earlier treaty making processes whereby West African 
territories became European protectorates. Protectorates were a loaded pause before the 
eventual European military occupation of West Africa. Because protectorate treaties posed 
serious challenges to West African independence most West African rulers naturally 
rejected them. West African rulers adopted numerous strategies to forestall European 
occupation including: recourse to diplomacy, alliance, and when all else failed, military 
confrontation. 
 
Recourse to Diplomacy 
The British found few people as difficult to subdue as the Asante of Ghana in their quest to 
build their West African colonial empire. The Asante Wars against the British, which began 
in 1805, lasted a hundred years. Although outmatched by superior weaponry, the Asante 
kept the British army at bay for a short final period of independence.

To understand the Asante wars, one has to look at role of King Prempeh I, who firmly 
resolved not to submit to British protection. When pressured in 1891 to sign a protection 
treaty which implied British control of Asante, Prempeh firmly and confidently rejected idea. 
Here are his words to the British envoy: 
The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her 
Majesty the Queen and Empress of India, is a matter of very serious consideration and I am 
happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never 
commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain [independent] of old . . . 
In 1897, King Prempeh was exiled, and the Asante were told that he would never be 
returned. He was first taken to Elmina Castle. From there, he was taken to the Seychelles 
Islands. 
In 1899, in a further attempt to humiliate the Asante people, the British sent British 
governor Sir Frederick Hodgson to Kumasi to demand the Golden Stool. The Golden Stool 
was a symbol of Asante unity. In the face of this insult the chiefs held a secret meeting at 
Kumasi. Yaa Asantewa, the Queen Mother of Ejisu, was at the meeting. The chiefs were 
discussing how they could make war on the white men and force them to bring back the 
Asantehene. Yaa Asantewa saw that some of the bravest male members of nation were 
cowed. In her now famous challenge, Yaa Asantewa declared: 
How can a proud and brave people like the Asante sit back and look while white men took 
away their king and chiefs and humiliate them with a demand for the Golden Stool. The 
Golden Stool only means money to the white man; they searched and dug everywhere for it 
. . . If you, the chiefs of Asante, are going to behave like cowards and not fight, you should 
exchange your loincloths for my undergarments. 
That was the beginning of the Yaa Asantewa War. The final battle began on September 30, 
1900, and ended in the bloody defeat of the Asante. Yaa Asantewa was the last to be 
captured, and subsequently exiled to the Seychelles, where she died around 1921. With the 
end of these wars, the British gained control of the hinterland of Ghana. 
Around the same time, Behanzin, the last king of Dahomey (1889-94), told the European 
envoy that came to see him: 
God has created Black and White, each to inherit its designated territory. The White man is 
concerned with commerce and the Black man must trade with the White. Let the Blacks do 
no harm to the Whites and in the same way the Whites must do not harm to the blacks. 
In 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Nabaor king of the Mossi told French Captain Restenave: 
I know the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they 
will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need 
of them. I know what is necessary for me and what I want: I have my own merchants: also, 
consider yourself fortunate that I do not order your head to be cut off. Go away now, and 
above all, never come back. 
 
Alliance 
When West African leaders struck alliances with the imperialists, they did so in an attempt 
to enhance their commercial and diplomatic advantages. King Jaja of Opobo, for instance, 
resorted to diplomacy as means of resistance to European intrusive imperialism. Mbanaso 
Ozurumba, a.k.a Jaja was a former slave of Igbo origin. He was elected as king of the Anna 
Pepple House in Bonny, Niger Delta, in 1863, following the death of his master. Soon a 
struggle between the Anna Pepple House and Manilla Pepple House led to the outbreak of 
civil war in Bonny in 1869. The war resulted in King Jaja’s migration and founding of the 
inland kingdom of Opobo which lay in the palm oil producing hinterland. 
Jaja was an avowed nationalist and determined to control the trade in his political domain. 
He was determined to prevent European incursions into the interior. He also wanted to 
ensure that Opobo oil markets remained outside the sphere of foreign traders. To this end, 
King Jaja signed a trade treaty with the British in 1873. Part of the treaty reads as follows: 
After April 2, 1873, the king of Opobo shall allow no trade established or hulk in or off 
Opobo Town, or any trading vessels to come higher up the river than the Whiteman’s beach 
opposite Hippopotamus Creek. If any trading ship or steamer proceeds further up the river 
than the creek above mentioned, after having been fully warned to the contrary, the said 
trading ship or steamer may be seized by King Jaja and detained until a fine of 100 
puncheon [of palm oil] be paid by the owners to king Jaja . . . 
By signing the treaty, the British acknowledged Jaja as the king of Opobo and dominant 
middleman in the Niger Delta trade. However, the ensuing scramble for Africa of 1880s 
upset the understanding. The British merchants and officials were no longer in the mood to 
respect Jaja’s preeminence in the Niger Delta hinterland. They instead penetrated the 
hinterland to open up free trade and therefore a confrontation with Jaja became inevitable. 
In 1887, the British consul Harry Johnson enticed Jaja to the British gunboat for discussions; 
but then exiled him to West Indies where he died in 1891. 
 
Military Confrontation 
Some decentralized West African societies equally resisted European penetration. 
The Baule of Ivory Coast and Tiv of Nigeria stiffly resisted colonial occupation. The Baule 
fought the French from 1891-1911. The Tiv fought the British from 1900-30; and Igbo 
resistance was particularly widespread and prolonged. Because of the egalitarian nature of 
their society, the British found it extremely difficult to subjugate them. The British literally 
had to fight their way from Igbo village to village, from town to town, before they could 
finally declare their imperial authority over the Igbo people. Igbo elders challenged the 
British imperial penetration and invited the British to: “Come and fight: if you want warm, 
come, we are ready.” The British waged wars from about 1898-1910. 
While West Africans fought gallantly against their European intruders; everywhere but 
Ethiopia, the Europeans were triumphant. 
 
European Political Policies in their West African Dominions 
 
The British in West Africa 
 
The 19th century British colonial policy in West Africa was a policy of assimilation. 
Their grand plan was to have Africans assimilate into European civilization and culture. The 
policy created a western class of black Englishmen who were supposedly British partners in 
religion, trade and administration. These African “British men,” especially Creoles, rose in 
colonies of Freetown, Bathurst, southern Ghana and Lagos to important positions in the 
church, commercial firms and the colonial government. However, with the growth of 
European racism, western educated Africans (elites) found that they were increasingly 
discriminated against in administration. The British now imported European administrators 
to fill positions previously held by Africans. Western educated Africans like the Creoles were 
even forced out of the civil service. 
In 1910, the British colonial office expressed the opinion that Englishmen naturally expected 
to enjoy fruits of their conquests, therefore they should be preferred over Africans in senior 
positions. The problem however was that there were not enough Englishmen prepared to 
serve as colonial administrators in Africa. Therefore, the British soon adopted the policy of 
Indirect Rule. 
Indirect Rule was the brain child of Lord Lugard. He presented the principles of the system in 
his book The Dual Mandate in Tropical Africa. In it, he identified the two most important 
administrative principles to employ in ruling alien people. The first was the principle of 
decentralization, in which he stressed importance of recognizing and ruling people through 
their indigenous authorities. He argued that the role of the British officers, except in critical 
areas such as taxation, military forces and the alienation of land, was to advise, not demand. 
The second principle, was the principle of continuity. Lugard argued that the British should 
utilize indigenous institutions and authorities, thereby preserving “continuity” with the past, 
while laying foundations for what he saw as the progressive improvement of indigenous 
society. 
Indirect Rule which begun as administrative expedient in Northern Nigeria, would eventually 
be imposed throughout their territories of British Africa. 
 
Administrative Policies 
The British set up separate administrative machines for each of their colonies. At the head 
of each colony was the governor, who was responsible to the Secretary of State at the 
colonial office. He administered the colony with assistance of a partly nominated legislative 
council and executive council of officials. Most of the laws of the colony were drawn up by 
the government or his council. 
Each colony was divided into regions under a regional or chief administrator. The regions 
were divided into provinces which were controlled by the provincial commissioners. Each 
province was divided into districts under leadership of a district commissioner. Each district 
was divided into one or more traditional states which were ruled by traditional rulers. 
 
Features of Indirect Rule 
Indirect Rule saw to the mapping out of relatively large areas which were subject to single 
authority: Smaller ethnic groups were included in the jurisdiction of their larger, more highly 
organized neighbors. And district heads, especially in Igbo and Ibibiolands, Nigeria, were 
appointed to defined areas without much consideration to their relationship with the 
populations under their authority. 
Indirect Rule sustained tyrannical and corrupt governments and promoted divisions in 
populations: In Northern Nigeria, the system strengthened the emirates, therefore 
increasing the possibility of revolution by the oppressed peasantry. In Igboland and 
Ibibiolands, warrant chiefs were created to fill the leadership positions, because the Igbo 
and Ibibios had no chiefs, instead they had egalitarian systems of government which 
recognized authority as coming directly from the people. These warrant chiefs were corrupt 
and miniature tyrants. Therefore, in 1929 when the British tried to impose direct taxation on 
Igboland, Igbo women challenged government and the Women’s War or Ogu umunwanyi 
ensued. The warrant chiefs were the main targets of the women’s attack. 
Indirect Rule weakened traditional rule: The traditional paramount ruler in British West 
Africa was not really the head of social and political order. Rather, he was a subordinate of 
the British overlord who used him to implement unpopular measures such as compulsory 
labor, taxation, and military enlistment. Moreover, the British had the power to dispose of 
traditional rulers and replace them with their own nominees. And the British often 
interfered with existing paramountcies by breaking them up and raising subordinate chiefs 
to the status of paramount chiefs. 
The British District officers dictated to traditional rulers and treated them as employees of 
government rather than supervising and advising them. Members of ruling families were 
not encouraged to attend new schools that were introduced for fear they may become 
denationalized. In northern Nigeria and northern Ghana, the people as a result were not 
given the sort of education that would enable them cope with new problems of colonial 
society, thus making them even more dependent on District Commissioners and British 
Technical Officers. 
The greatest fault of the Indirect Rule system, however, was its complete exclusion of the 
West African educated elite from local government: the educated elite were excluded from 
both Native Administration and colonial government, and thus became transformed into an 
alienated class. 
In conclusion, Indirect Rule was implemented because it was cheap and practical. It 
preserved old conservative authorities who were ill equipped by education and 
temperament to cope with the changing environment. 
 
The French in West Africa 
 
Administrative Policies 
The French had a policy of assimilation which sought to “civilize” indigenes and gradually 
turn them into petits Français or junior Frenchmen. The highest-ranking of these juniors 
were the évolués, or evolved ones. They were colonial subjects trained to work in 
administrative positions. 
Évolués served two purposes. First, to cut down on costs by replacing French manpower. 
Second, to create an illusion that colonials were profiting from their becoming “civilized.” 
Both the junior Frenchmen or petits Français and the evolved ones or évolués were to serve 
the grandeur of France and in the far, far, future, they would become “civilized” enough to 
be considered fully French. This would never really happen however. When independence 
came, these well-positioned évolués often ended up running their countries. 
In French West Africa, the colonies were integral parts of the metropolitan country, and 
were also considered overseas provinces. West Africans were regarded as subjects of 
France, and like children were expected to have patriotic duties to their mother country. 
The French believed that the first duty of civilization to the savage was to give them “a taste 
for work” on the grounds that as beneficiaries of civilization, they should contribute to 
expenses of the country which brings them benefits. In keeping with this philosophy, the 
primary role of the “native” therefore was to fight and produce for mother country. The 
French believed that the “native” will inevitably be civilized by this process, so that in 
helping France, the “native,” in fact, helps him- or herself. 
West Africans that were deemed civilized were rewarded by conferring the privileged status 
of French citizen on them. To become a French citizen, the West African would have to have 
been born in one of the four communes or municipalities in Senegal: Saint-Louis, Gorée, 
Rufisque, and Dakar. They must also have a merited a position in the French service for at 
least ten years; and have evidence of good character and possess a means of 
existence. They must also have been decorated with the Legion of Honor, a military award. 
The advantages of French citizenship were many. Once a West African became a 
Frenchman, they were subject to French law and access to French courts. The black 
Frenchman was exempted from indigénat, which is a legal system which enabled a French 
administrative officer to sentence any African for up to two years forced labour without a 
trial. A West African Frenchman could commute compulsory labor for a monetary 
payment. The person could be appointed to any post in France and in colony. For example, 
Blaise Diagne of Senegal was the first black African elected to French National Assembly and 
Mayor of Dakar, which was the capital of the Federation of French West Africa. He would 
however fall out of favor with West Africans because the French colonial government used 
him to forcibly conscript West Africans to fight for the French army during WWI. 
However, the assimilation policy was abandoned as impractical. By 1937, only eighty 
thousand of the fifteen million French West Africans had become French citizens. Seventy-
eight thousand of those had because French citizens because they were born in one of the 
communes. 
Thus, in the 1920s, the policy was changed to the policy of association, which was advocated 
as the most appropriate for French Africa. On paper, association reorganized the society 
supposedly to achieve maximum benefit for both the French and the West African. In 
practice however, scholars have argued that this policy was like the association of a horse 
and its rider, since the French would at all times dictate the direction that the development 
should take and determine what would be of mutual benefit to themselves and West 
Africans. 
The colonial belief in the superiority of French civilization was reflected in the judicial 
system, their attitude toward indigenous law, indigenous authorities, indigenous rights to 
land, and the educational program. They condemned everything African as primitive and 
barbaric. 
 
Actual Administration 
The French employed a highly centralized and authoritarian system of administration. 
Between 1896 and 1904, they formed all of their eight West African colonies into the 
Federation of French West Africa (AVF), with its capital at Dakar. 
At the head of Federation was governor-general who answered to minister of colonies in 
Paris, took most of his orders from France, and governed according to French laws. At the 
head of each colony was the Lt.-governor who was assisted by a council of administration. 
The Lt.-governor was directly under the governor-general and could make decisions on only 
a few specified subjects. The French policy of assimilation, was a policy of direct rule 
through appointed officials. Like British, they divided their colonies into regions and 
districts. The colonies were divided into cercles under the commandants du cercles. Cercles 
were divided into subdivisions under Chiefs du Subdivision. Subdivisions were divided into 
cantons under African chiefs. 
 
Distinguishing Features 
1. African Chiefs were not local government authorities. They could not exercise any 
judicial functions. They did not have a police force or maintain prisons. 
2. African chiefs were not leaders of their people. Rather, they were mere 
functionaries, supervised by French political officers. 
3. African chiefs were appointed, not by birth, but rather by education, and familiarity 
with the metropolitan administrative practice. 
4. African chiefs could be transferred from one province to another. The French policy 
actually went out of its way to deliberately destroy traditional paramountcies. 
 
The Portuguese in West Africa 
 
Administrative Policies 
Portugal, one of the poorest of the European colonist nations in Africa operated what 
amounted to a closed economic system in their African colonies. They created a system 
which welded their West African colonies to mother country, Portugal, both politically and 
economically. As such, their territories in West Africa were considered overseas provinces 
and integral part of Portugal. 
 
Actual Administration 
One underlying connection of all West African Portuguese colonies was the presence of 
relatively large numbers of Portuguese in the colonies, especially after 1945 when there was 
a full-scale emigration program from Portugal, especially to Angola. The Portuguese 
operated a very authoritarian and centralized system of government. At the top of 
government was the Prime Minister. Under him were the Council of Ministers and the 
Overseas Ministry, which was made up of the Overseas Advisory Council, and the General 
Overseas Agency. Then there was the Governor General, a Secretariat and Legislative 
Council. All of these offices were in Portugal. There were also Governors of Districts, 
Administrators of Circumscricoes, Chefes de posto and at the very bottom of the 
governmental hierarchy, the African Chiefs. 
As in the British case, the Portuguese corrupted the systems of chieftaincies. They sacked 
chiefs who resisted colonial rule in Guine, and replaced them with more pliant chiefs. Thus, 
the historical authority of chiefs and their relationships with subjects was corrupted to one 
of authoritarianism which reproduced the authoritarian system of government in the Estado 
Novo dictatorship (1926-74). 
Real authority was held by the Portuguese council of ministers, which was controlled by the 
prime minister. The direction of colonial policy was determined by the overseas ministry, 
aided by the advisory overseas council and two subsidiary agencies. The governor-general 
appointed the chief official resident for the colony. The chief official of the resident for the 
colony had far reaching executive and legislative power. He headed the colonial 
bureaucracy, directed the native authority system, and was responsible for the colonies’ 
finances. 
The Circumscricoes and Chefes de posto roughly corresponded to the British provincial and 
district officers. They collected taxes, were judges and finance officers. West African chiefs 
were subordinate to the European officers with little power to act on their own. Moreover, 
they could be replaced at any time by a higher Portuguese power. 
The political policy adopted in Guinea Bissau, São Tomé, Principe, and Cape Verdes, 
Portugal’s West African territories was a system of assimilado. The assimilado policy held 
that all persons, no matter their race, would be accorded this status if they met the specific 
qualifications. Similar to the French policy of assimilation, the Portuguese West African had 
to adopt a European mode of life; speak and read Portuguese fluently; be a Christian; 
compete military service; and have a trade or profession. However, only a small number 
Portuguese West Africans became assimilados because of the difficulty in achieving this 
station. 
Additionally, the Portuguese did not support education in their colonies. They built few 
secondary schools, and almost entirely neglected elementary education. Most of their 
emphasis was given to rudimentary levels of training where Portuguese West African 
students were taught moral principles and basic Portuguese; making it almost impossible for 
the Portuguese West African, even if she or he wanted to, to achieve the status of 
assimilado. 
 
The Germans in West Africa 
 
Administrative Policies 
The Germans had two territories in West Africa—Togo and Kameroon. German colonialism 
was too short-lived to establish a coherent administrative policy. German African colonial 
experience essentially amounted to thirty years (1884-1914) and was characterized by 
bloody African rebellions. However, their harsh treatment resulted in intervention and 
direct rule by German government. The German colonialists envisioned a “New Germany” in 
Africa in which colonialists would be projected as members of a superior and enlightened 
race; while Africans were projected as inferior, indolent, and destined to be permanent 
subjects of Germans. 
 
Actual Administration 
The Germans had a highly centralized administration. At the top of government was the 
Emperor. The Emperor was assisted by the Chancellor, who was assisted by Colonial 
Officers, who supervised the administration. At the bottom were the jumbes or subordinate 
African staff. These men had been placed in the stead of recognized leadership. 
 
European Economic and Social Policies in their West African Dominions 
The cardinal principles of the European colonial economic relationship in West Africa were 
to: (1) stimulate the production and export of West African cash crops including palm 
produce, groundnuts, cotton, rubber, cocoa, coffee and timber; (2) encourage the 
consumption and expand the importation of European manufactured goods; (3) ensure that 
the West African colony’s trade, both imports and exports, were conducted with the 
metropolitan European country concerned. The colonialists thus instituted the Colonial Pact 
which ensured that West African colonies must provide agricultural export products for 
their imperial country and buy its manufactured goods in return, even when they could get 
better deals elsewhere. 
To facilitate this process, the colonialists therefore forced West Africans to participate in a 
monetized market economy. They introduced new currencies, which were tied to currencies 
of the metropolitan countries to replace the local currencies and barter trade. Railroads 
were a central element in the imposition of the colonial economic and political structures. 
Colonial railways did not link West African economies and production together. They did not 
link West African communities together either, rather they served the purpose of linking 
West African producers to international trade and market place; and also connecting 
production areas to the West African coast. Moreover, railroads meant that larger amounts 
of West African produced crops could be sent to coast. All equipment used to build and 
operate the railroads were manufactured in Europe, and brought little to no economic 
growth to West Africa beyond reinforcing the production of West African cash crops for the 
external market. What was more, thousands of West African men were forced to construct 
these railroads; and many died doing so. 
The key to the development of colonial economies in West Africa, was the need to control 
labor. In the colonies, this labor was forced. There were basically two types of forced labor 
in Africa. The first, was peasant labor. This occurred in most parts of West Africa where 
agriculture was already mainstay. In East, Central, and South Africa, Africans performed 
migrant wage labor on European owned and managed mines and plantations. 
The colonial masters also imposed taxation in West Africa. By taxing rural produce, the 
colonial state could force West Africans to farm cash crops. West Africans had to sell 
sustenance crops on the market for cash. Then use cash to pay taxes. Taxes could be 
imposed on land, produce, and homes (hut tax). The requirement to pay tax forced West 
Africans into the colonial labour market. 
 
West African Response and Initiatives 
The imposition of foreign domination on West Africa did not go unchallenged. West 
Africans adopted different strategies to ensure survival. Some West African people living 
outside the cash crop areas found that they could get away with very little contact with the 
Europeans. Others exploited the system for their own gain by playing on the colonial 
government’s ignorance of specific regions’ histories. Still others pursued Western 
education and Christianity while holding strong to their identities. West African people 
struggled against the breaking up of their historical states as well as any threat to their land 
through petitions, litigations, uprisings 
 
Early Protest Movements 
West Africans organized protest against colonialism in form of the assertion of the right to 
self-rule. Some of the most notable movements included: (1) The Fante Confederacy (1868-
72) of the Gold Coast, which recommended British withdrawal from all of her West African 
colonies; (2) The Egba United Board of Management (1865) of Nigeria, which aimed to 
introduce legal reforms and tolls on European lines, establish postal communications in 
Lagos; (3) The aborigines Rights Protection Society (1897) of the Gold Coast was formed to 
oppose government proposals to classify unoccupied land as crown land (meaning that the 
land belongs to government). In the 1920’s colonial administration succeeded in breaking 
alliance by supporting chiefs against the elite; (4) The National Congress of British West 
Africa (1920). The Congress was formed in Accra in 1920 under the leadership of J. E. Casely-
Hayford, an early nationalist, and distinguished Gold Coast lawyer. Its aims were to press for 
constitution and other reforms, demand Legislative Council in each territory with half of 
members made up of elected Africa. They opposed discrimination against Africans in civil 
service, asked for a West African university, and asked for stricter immigration controls to 
exclude “undesirable” Syrians (business elite).

The African Church Movement or Ethiopianism 
 In the religious sphere, the Creoles played an important role in Christianizing many parts of 
West Africa including, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Abeokuta, and the Niger Delta. However, they 
soon met with the same kind of British racial arrogance encountered by West Africans in the 
colonial government. The British replaced Creole archbishops and superintendents with 
Europeans. A European succeeded Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, and no African was 
consecrated to this high office again for next sixty years. 
The West African response to this was to break away from European churches and form 
new, independent West African churches. These churches included: the African Baptists, 
United Native African Church, African Church, United African Methodists—all in Nigeria, the 
United Native Church in Cameroon; and the William Harry Church in Ivory Coast. By 1920, 
there were no less than 14 churches under exclusive African control. In Fernando Po, 
Reverend James Johnson was leading figure of the African church movement until his death 
in 1917. 
The Independence movement among churches demanded that control be vested in West 
African lay or clerical leaders. Many churches incorporated aspects of West African ideas of 
worship into their liturgies, showing more tolerance for West African social institutions like 
polygamy. 
The Prophetic Church Movement also emerged during this time, propelling the 
establishment of at least three prominent churches in West Africa which related Christianity 
to current West African beliefs. These prophets offered prayers for the problems that 
plagued people in villages, problems which traditional diviners had previously offered 
assistance in form of sacrifices to various gods. The Prophet Garrick Braide movement 
Began in 1912, ending with imprisonment in 1916. The Prophet William Wade Harris 
movement began in 1912, reached its height in 1914-15, spreading his gospel in the Ivory 
Coast, Liberia, and Gold Coast. The Aladura (people of prayer) Movement in Western 
Nigeria, began during the influenza epidemic (1918-19), achieving its greatest impact during 
Great Revival of 1930. 
The African Church and prophetic movement was represented a nationalist reaction against 
white domination in religious sphere, whim encouraged Africans to adopt African names at 
baptism, adapt songs to traditional flavors, and translate the bible and prayer books into 
West African languages. 
Despite the rapid spread of Christianity in West Africa, Islam was spreading even more 
rapidly. West Africans embraced Islam as a form of protest against colonialism because it 
offered a wider world view devoid of the indignity of assimilation to the colonial master’s 
culture. 
 
The Role of West African Newspapers 
 The emergence of African owned presses and newspapers played an important role in 
sowing the seeds of early nationalism. The West African elite, through their newspapers and 
associations, acted as watchdogs of the colonial government, protecting their citizens 
against its abuses. Isaac Wallace Johnson and Nnamdi Azikiwe, for instance, were active in 
the West African press; and the press served as an important element in keeping the elite 
united. The Sierra Leone Weekly News was founded in 1884, and the Gold Coast 
Independent first published in 1885. In Nigeria, the Lagos Weekly Record was established in 
1890 by John Payne Jackson. He propagated racial and national consciousness in Nigeria 
during the period. All worked to spread nationalism among West Africans. The press was in 
fact the single most important element in the birth and development of nationalism in 
British West Africa. 
West Africans Abroad 
 
Many of West African’s future nationalist leaders, including, Leopold Senghor, Kwame 
Nkrumah, and Nnamdi Azikiwe studied abroad. They obtained necessary education to fight 
white domination effectively. The fact that they often suffered from white racism while 
abroad made them far more militant. Azikiwe and Nkrumah studied at the Historically Black 
College, Lincoln University (United States of America).

In London, the West African Student Union was founded in 1925 by Nigerian law student, 
Ladipo Solanke. Solanke, one of fathers of Nigerian nationalism, toured West Africa to raise 
funds for union which published its own journal. Members stressed cultural nationalism and 
emphasized the greatness of the African past. One of members, Ghanaian J. W. de Graft-
Johnson, published book called The Vanished Glory. Members believed that West Africans 
should seeks their independence in near future. 
 
The Ethiopian Crisis, 1935 
 West Africans were jolted towards radicalism by Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. 
Ethiopia held a special significance for colonized Africans. It was an ancient Christian 
kingdom, an island of freedom in a colonized continent. Ethiopia was taken as symbol for 
African and African Christians. Nkrumah who was in London at time later recalled, “at that 
time it was almost as if the whole of London had suddenly declared war on me personally.” 
 
Effects of WWI, 1914-1918 
 WW1 had far reaching political and economic impact on West Africa. French West Africans 
were more affected than those in the British colonies. It is estimated that 211,000 Africans 
were recruited from Francophone Africa. Of these 163,952 fought in Europe. Official figures 
say that 24,762 died, but this number is assumed to be low, and did not account for Africans 
missing in action. Compulsory military service was introduced in 1912. From 1915, French 
West Africans actively resisted, as wounded and mutilated Africans began to return home. It 
soon became obvious that no adequate provision made for families of absent soldiers. Few 
Africans fought in British Africa. They took part in the conquest of Togo and Kameron. 5000 
carriers were sent from Sierra Leone, and over 1000 Nigerians and Ghanaian were killed or 
died of disease there. 
 
Effects of the War 
1. After war, following the decisions reached in the Treaty of Versailles, German 
colonies were taken away and handed over to Britain and France to be administered 
by them on behalf of League of Nations. Thus, the British and French occupied 
German Togo and Cameroon. Colonies consequently converted into mandated or 
trusteeship territories. 
2. WW1 influenced African Nationalism: African soldiers from both French and English 
territories fought Germans in Togo, Cameroons and Tanganyika. During those 
campaigns African soldiers gained some knowledge of outside world which widened 
outlook. They fought side by side with Europeans and discovered their strengths and 
weaknesses. They returned home with experience which deeply influenced desire 
for freedom and liberty 
3. WW1 led to the arbitrary division of Togo and Cameroon between France and Britain 
as result of Treaty of Versailles: The division was made without reference to peoples, 
and this offended the latter’s sense of justice and fair play. Thus, the people 
developed a strong hatred for colonialism. For instance, the Ewes of Togo were split 
by division, and thus, organized “Ewe Union Movement” to appeal for remerging of 
their ethnic group. 
4. WW1 allowed West Africans access to external wartime rhetoric, which had 
tremendous impact upon the thoughts and aspirations of literate West Africans. 
Woodrow Wilson (US) and Prime Minister Lloyd George of Britain made statements 
about principles of self-determination. West Africans believed that these principles 
were just as applicable to the colonies as to occupied territories of Europe. 
5. WW1 led to tremendous decrease in West African import trade and revenues from 
customs declined. 
Negro World Movements 
 The 1st Pan African Congress was held in Trinidad in 1900 and attended mainly by West 
Indians. Like early nationalistic movements, this Pan African Congress was elitist and 
concerned with issues such as the disabilities of black civil servants. The 2nd Pan African 
Congress was held in Paris in 1919 under the initiative of W. E. B. Dubois, the founder of the 
National Association of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who hoped that the 
problems of black people would be included in discussions of the Peace Conference at the 
end of WW1. Resolutions made at this congress were moderate. Few delegates from English 
West Africa attended. Later congresses in 1921, 1923, and 1927 were even weaker and less 
influential.

Marcus Garvey (1887-1940) 
Marcus Garvey was the founder of Universal Negro Improvement Association. A Jamaican 
resident in New York, he influenced West Africans profoundly. He spoke of pride in black 
identity and said that to be an African was a matter of joy and pride, and that black men 
everywhere would gain their rights by militancy and not by supplication. Branches of the 
movement were established in Lagos and Gold Coast. Garvey urged black people in the New 
World to return to Africa and fight or what was their own. Liberia was going to be the 
launching point for this return. He founded a shipping company called the Black Star Line to 
strength links between Africa and Afro-Americans. 
 
Youth Movements of the 1930s 
 In the 1930s, a series of new movements sprang up in Nigeria, the Gold Coast, and Sierra 
Leone. They called themselves Youth movements, not because their members were youth—
they were often middle aged—but because the word, youth, was often used in West Africa 
to symbolize one’s rejection of the past. One such movement was the Gold Coast Youth 
Conference (1930), organized by J. B. Danquah. It was not a political party, but a discussion 
center which brought together larger numbers of debating clubs to discuss issues of national 
importance. In 1934, the Lagos Youth Movement was founded by a group of young men led 
by Ernest Ikoli, Samuel Akinsanya, Dr. J.C. Vaughan formed. In 1936, it changed its name to 
the Nigerian youth movement. The movement was restricted first to Lagos, then Nnamdi 
Azikiwe and H. O. Davies joined on their return to Nigeria in 1937 and 1938 respectively, and 
the movement became nationalistic in its outlook. The West African Youth League was 
formed in 1938. Organized by Sierra Leonean, Isaac Wallace-Johnson, it favored Marxism. 
Wallace-Johnson had international background. He had visited London and Moscow and had 
worked for communist newspaper in Hamburg. On his return to the Gold Coast, he was 
jailed for sedition. 
 
Effect of WWII 
WWII accelerated the growth of nationalism and shook the foundations of imperialism. The 
economic impact of the war on West Africa was tremendous and far reaching, resulting in 
(1) an increased economic importance of West Africa to the world market. Europe began to 
depend more on tropical Africa to supply rubber, cotton, cocoa, palm produce, and 
groundnuts. Thus, West African colonies increased the production of these cash crops. In 
Nigeria for instance, value of exports rose from 10,300,00 pounds in 1931 to 24,600,00 
pounds in 1946. Imports rose from 6,800,00 pounds to 19,800,00 pounds during the same 
period. (2) West African workers developed grievances as a result of the colonial 
government introducing price control, controlling marketing of export crops, introducing 
wage ceilings, and pressuring for more production, Moreover, African businessmen were 
excluded from the import and export trade which was now reserved only for European 
firms. (3) The rise of trade unions emerged as a result of the rise of the cost of living without 
corresponding rise in wages. This provided stimulus for organizational activity among the 
labor class. In Nigeria the number of trade unions rose from 5 to 70, and the Nigerian Trade 
Union Congress (1943) became central coordinating body. Trade unions cooperated closely 
with nationalist leaders in pressing for the end of colonialism. (4) War resulted in speedy 
growth of cities as result of people flocking into cities to take up new jobs. Many West 
African cities more than doubled their population. Lagos rose from 100,000 in 1939 to 
230,00 in 1950. Accra rose from 70,000 in 1941 to 166,00 in 1948. Towns became 
overcrowded with discontented job-seeker and workers who witnessed whites living in 
comfortable, spacious European reservations with paved streets and beautiful lawns and 
gardens, while they were living in slums. The people therefore became receptive to 
nationalist appeal and would become the first willing recruits into militant nationalist 
movement. (5) War gave impetus to education in West Africa. Because of increased 
prosperity resulting from war time economic boom, more parents could afford to send 
children to school, literacy spread, and newspaper readership increased. Newspapers 
became a powerful tool in hands of nationalists to push for political, economic and social 
development. (6) In spite of more job opportunities, thousands of school-leavers remained 
unemployed. For the first time, West African cities developed a new class of unemployed 
people especially in cities. They became disgruntled and blamed colonial government and 
European firms for their plight. They were easily won over by nationalist agitators. (7) The 
most decisive factor that accelerated the growth of nationalism was however the return of 
ex-servicemen. Over 176,000 men from British West Africa served in British colonial army 
during war. After war, large numbers of survivors returned. About 100,000 returned to 
Nigeria, and 65,000 retuned to Ghana from the Middle East, East Africa, Burma and India. 
Ex-service men had seen life in more developed countries and enjoyed high living standards 
in army. They had seen the strength of nationalist movements in Asia and fought side by 
side with Europeans and seen weaknesses which exposed the myth of European racial 
superiority. They came home with burning desire for better life for themselves and people 
and urgent demand for extension to Africa of freedom for which many of them had fought 
and died. Many joined ranks of militant nationalists. 

The Impact of European Colonialism on West Africa 
 
Belgium’s King Leopold, speaking at the 1884 Berlin West Africa conference, was attributed 
with saying, “I am determined to get my share of this magnificent African Cake.” Tragically, 
as history reveals, Leopold did get a considerable share of the “magnificent African cake,” 
which he exploited with unimaginable brutality. While European colonialism in West Africa 
lasted for a period of only about eighty years, the basic impetus for colonialism was to 
control existing West African markets, its mineral wealth, as well as to control its future 
economic discoveries. Portuguese dictator Marcelo Caetano put it this way, “[West African] 
Blacks are to be organized and enclosed in economies directed by whites.” Indeed, 
European colonial rule took much more from West Africa than it gave it. 
Colonialism was a double-edged-sword. While the European colonialists saw to the building 
of roads, railroads, ports, and new technology in West Africa, the infrastructure developed 
by them, and built with West African forced labor, was designed to exploit the natural 
resources of the colonies; and advance European colonial presence in West Africa. Effective 
colonial government control demanded a more efficient system of communications that 
previously existed in precolonial West Africa. Thus, in colonial northern Nigeria, for instance, 
railroads were specifically built for this purpose. With the discovery of mineral deposits in 
areas of colonial Sierra Leone, railways were either extended or spur lines were built to 
facilitate the exploitation of these minerals. In addition to railroads, the colonialists also 
improved and expanded the road networks in their various West African territories. This 
they did, much like the railways, to link production areas to the coasts. These roads however 
had the added effect of providing the impetus for increasing urbanization in West African 
cities and towns. 
 
A Section Chief in the building of the Dakar–Niger Railway, pushed by African workers, 
Kayes, Mali, 1904 - Robert Schléber, Kayes - Collection Jean-Pierre Vergez-Larrouy (1903). 
As mentioned above, colonial investments in West Africa were concentrated, for the most 
part, on extractive industries and trade goods. In order to exploit these raw materials, the 
colonial governments had to control labor. They did this by encouraging large numbers of 
skilled and unskilled laborers to concentrate in given locales. This resulted in the 
tremendous growth of towns and cities in the vicinities of these industries. 
Another reason for the growth of new towns and cities, as well as urbanization, was the 
need to service the new agricultural sectors imposed by the colonial governments. Seaports, 
in cities like Dakar, Lagos, and Abidjan, thus, registered remarkable growth rates in the fifty 
years of the twentieth century. The same was true of towns selected by the colonial 
government as sites for the headquarters of the various colonial districts and provinces. 
The introduction of cash economies also had far reaching effects on urbanization in West 
African societies. By introducing taxation, Europeans could force Africans into the 
monetarized economy. Young men found it much easier to obtain European currency by 
working in government or civilian sector jobs in towns and cities, rather than working on the 
plantations, which many were forced to do. Thus, a greater mobility created by the roads 
and railroad networks, in addition to greater economic opportunities in certain colonial 
vicinities, combined to facilitate the rapid growth of West African cities. This growth in cities 
however had debilitating consequences on West African families. Migrant work encouraged 
the separation of families. 
In addition, the emphasis on cash crops grown for export made West African societies 
dependent on European economies. Little was done by the European colonialists to develop 
trade between West African colonies; and as a result, many West African nations still trade 
more with European countries than with neighboring West African states. Moreover, the 
land on which the European colonialists established these cash cropping plantations was 
seized forcibly from West Africans, leaving households landless, and dependent on the 
Europeans. 
While the various missionary societies proselytizing in West Africa, introduced schools of 
European learning in their West African dominions, as noted above, these for the most part, 
were far and few between. After the introduction of indirect rule, for instance, the British 
discouraged West Africans from acquiring higher education by denying them employment in 
the colonial administrations. They instead subsidized Christian missions to produce more 
clerks and interpreters. The French government on their part, limited the number of schools 
in their West African territories. Indeed, Senegal was the only colony that had secondary 
schools; and of these schools, the William Ponty school in Dakar was the oldest and most 
popular.

9 - Problems of Independent West African States 
 
Most West African leaders were very optimistic about their countries’ future at 
independence. They hoped to transform their newly independent countries so that their 
citizens would enjoy the fruits of independence, as colonial rule had brought only few 
benefits to the majority of the people. And indeed, some started well. They formulated 
good policies for the social and economic development of their people. School enrolment, 
for example, increased substantially in the first decade of independence. The road network 
was expanded and hospitals and clinics were built. However, these impressive 
developments were soon overshadowed by many problems, some of which have still not 
been solved. We shall discuss below the major problems that have affected West African 
countries since the attainment of independence. 
 
Problems of national unity and cohesion: Overview and Case Studies 
West African rulers have faced serious challenges in trying to unite their people. These 
rulers inherited states that had been created by European colonialists which consisted of 
different ethnic groups, religions and interests. The colonial regimes had created national 
boundaries which brought peoples together who would otherwise be separated (for 
example, the Fante and Asante in Ghana) and separated peoples who would otherwise be 
together. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin. The 
Senufo are found in Mali, Côte d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso. The Soso are in Sierra Leone and 
Guinea while the Kissi are now located in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. 
Unfortunately, West Africa’s leaders have not made greater efforts to unite the different 
communities in their countries. Thus, members of each group have tended to identify 
themselves more with their ethnic group rather than with their country and loyalty to the 
ethnic group is often more important than loyalty to the state. Sometimes political leaders 
even consciously promote ethnic discord in order to fulfil their selfish desires. Creating a 
viable nation-state (unity in diversity) from these different communities has been difficult 
for most West African leaders. 
The political parties in most independent West African states have compounded the 
problem. These parties, especially those formed during the period of the nationalist struggle 
for independence, were mostly ethnic or regionally based organisations. Nationalist leaders 
had appealed mainly to their regions or ethnic groups for support. Even after independence, 
these parties continued to operate like regional rather than national parties. This has led to 
serious political problems, especially during election periods. The reason is that politics in 
post-independent countries centres around the distribution of resources, not on ideologies. 
Whatever party is in power tends to allocate huge resources to their strongholds and 
appoint people from their regions to strategic positions, to the detriment and annoyance of 
people from other regions. It undermines the unity and stability of these states and is 
sometimes the primary cause of internal conflicts. 
Sierra Leone 
Sierra Leone’s two main political parties, the All People’s Congress (APC) and Sierra Leone 
People’s Party (SLPP), for example, have suffered from being labelled regional parties. 
Although the parties have made efforts to expand their support base, the APC is still 
perceived as a north-western based party and SLPP as south-eastern. This problem is 
common in many other West African countries. 
 
Nigeria 
In Nigeria, ethnic/regional animosities resulting in part from perceived dominance of one 
group over the other led to a bitter civil war in 1966. Nigeria’s three main ethnic groups, the 
Hausa/Fulani, the Yoruba and the Igbo, competed intensely for prominent positions in the 
post-colonial era. The Hausa/Fulani who lived in the north, were mainly Muslim and 
because of their large population, dominated Nigerian politics. The Yoruba in the southwest 
also had a significant Muslim population and were prominent in the economy. The Igbo in 
the southeast were mostly Christian and because of their superior Western education, 
occupied strategic positions all over Nigeria. This created resentment among especially the 
northerners and in January 1966, anti-Igbo sentiments erupted in the north when a group of 
mostly young Igbo military officers killed the Prime Minister, Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, and 
established a military regime with an Igbo, General Aguiyi Ironsi, as Head of State. Bitterness 
mounted and many Igbo living in the northern towns were massacred. In July, a group of 
northern officers murdered Ironsi and installed Lieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon (a 
northerner but Christian) as Head of State. Thereafter, the military governor of the Eastern 
Region, Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu (an Igbo), took steps to 
withdraw his region from the Nigerian Federation. Secession was formally declared in May 
1967, when Ojukwu proclaimed the independence of the new state of Biafra. 
Biafra contained almost all the oilfields which provided a substantial amount of Nigeria’s 
wealth. Nigeria’s military leaders were resolute to preserve the unity of the country and this 
led to a very bloody civil war from 1967-70. Ojukwu led the Biafran forces, while Gowon was 
in charge of the Federal army. After nearly four years of bitter fighting which resulted in 
many casualties on both sides, the Federal troops prevailed. Ojukwu fled to Côte d’Ivoire 
but later returned to Nigeria. General Gowon did not punish those who had sided with the 
rebel republic of Biafra. Strenuous efforts were then made to preserve Nigerian unity and it 
has been a shaky unity since. 
 
Côte d’Ivoire: the ‘west’ vs the ‘north’ 
Côte d’Ivoire has also suffered problems of national unity. During the long rule of President 
Félix Houphouët-Boigny (1960-93), he had encouraged the migration of foreign workers and 
labourers from the north of Côte d’Ivoire (including workers from Burkina Faso) to support 
the expansion of cocoa plantations in the west of the country. This policy led to anti-
immigrant feelings which were made worse as the global price of cocoa fell and the country 
entered a recession in the 1990s. 
At the same time, Houphouët-Boigny bowed to pressure and opened up the political space. 
Laurent Gbagbo of the Front populaire ivorien–FPI (Ivoirian Popular Front) became his main 
rival. Gbagbo drew much of his support from groups in the cocoa producing areas. In the 
ensuing elections, which were characterised by vote rigging, Houphouët-Boigny won by 82 
per cent. Following Houphouët-Boigny’s death in 1993, Henri Konan Bédié became 
President. Bédié capitalised on the anti-immigrant feelings to build solid support. He 
introduced the idea of Ivoirité (Ivorianess) in order to exclude ‘foreigners’ from the north. 
He passed a law which prevented his main challenger Alassane Ouattara, who had once 
served as Prime Minister in Côte d’Ivoire and who was a northerner, from participating in 
the 1995 elections. Ouattara’s exclusion from the political process marked the start of 
increasing political marginalisation and heightened regional tensions, which led to a military 
coup by General Robert Guéi in 1999. 
Ouattara was again prevented from participating in the October 2000 elections. Guéi and 
Gbagbo contested and although it was widely thought that Gbagbo had won, Guéi refused 
to leave office. Massive protests ensued and eventually Guéï fled, bringing Gbagbo into 
power. 
Gbagbo sought to consolidate his position by again marginalising the northerners. In 
September 2002, several northern army officers tried to overthrow his government. These 
officers, led by Guillaume Soro and their supporters, formed the Forces Nouvelles de Côte 
d’Ivoire (New Forces) and quickly gained control of the northern half of the country, 
plunging Côte d’Ivoire into a civil war. The war only came to an end in 2007 when Gbagbo 
and Soro signed the Ouagadougou Agreement. Soro was appointed Prime Minister. 
Ouattara finally took part in the October 2010 elections against Gbagbo and defeated him. 
However, Gbagbo refused to accept the results and this led to violent clashes between 
Ouattara’s supporters and those of Gbagbo. With the backing of French troops, Côte 
d’Ivoire’s forces overpowered the Gbagbo loyalists. Gbagbo was eventually captured and 
thereafter, Ouattara became President. The conflict had greatly damaged Côte d’Ivoire’s 
economy. It also led to the death of about 3000 people. 
Pervasive influence of the former colonial powers 
The European countries that had colonised West Africa namely Britain, France and Portugal, 
had grudgingly granted independence to their colonies, due to internal and external 
pressures. In spite of independence, these European countries and other Western nations 
still desired to influence in one form or the other the politics, economy and culture of their 
former colonies, and often in alliance with West Africa’s rulers. The first Presidents of 
independent postcolonial nations, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Sekou Touré of Guinea 
(Conakry), were strongly against this practice. They wanted their countries to completely cut 
off the yoke of colonialism. 
But this was to be achieved at a very high price. When Sekou Touré decided to reduce 
considerably his country’s ties with France, the French practically destroyed Guinea. They 
damaged public infrastructure and took away to France whatever valuable property they 
could lay hands on. They also later refused to allo Guinea access to the common currency 
used across their former colonies, the CFA, which was tied in value to the French franc, as it 
now is to the Euro. Kwame Nkrumah offered a lot of material assistance to Guinea during 
that country’s first few years of independence. 
Nkrumah coined the term neo-colonialism to refer to the indirect political, economic and 
social control of African nations by their former colonial overlords. Some West African 
leaders tried to add political meaning to their country’s independence and at the same time 
remove vestiges of colonialism by joining the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). The NAM was 
formed by countries who did not want to be directly involved or connected with the intense 
Cold War rivalry between the post-war super powers, the Soviet Union and the United 
States of America. 
In addition, some leaders formulated ideologies akin to socialism, which they believed 
would help their people. Nkrumah called his new ideology Nkrumaism. His Convention 
People’s Party (CPP) stated that the guiding principles of Nkrumaism were: social justice, 
Pan-Africanism, self determination, African personality and, anti-imperialism. 
In order to implement the Nkrumaism ideology, Nkrumah turned to Eastern countries in the 
Soviet Bloc for assistance. In this way, he became closely aligned to the Soviet Bloc. The USA 
did not like Nkrumah’s close ties with the Soviet Bloc, because the Americans wanted West 
African countries and many others in Africa and elsewhere to be under the influence of the 
USA and its Western allies. It is believed that the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
may have played an important role in the overthrow of Nkrumah in 1996. It is significant 
that Nkrumah was overthrown by the Ghanaian army on 24 February 1966, when he was on 
a State visit to North Vietnam and China. 
 
Neo-colonialism and economic underdevelopment 
In spite of the abundant natural resources that most West African countries possess, they 
are still economically poor and under-developed. The living standards of the people are very 
low and basic social services are deplorable. The reasons for this unsatisfactory state of 
affairs are many and some of them will be discussed later in this chapter. However, certain 
people think that the roots of the major socio-economic problems facing West African 
countries today can be traced back to the colonial period and the influence of neo-
colonialism. 
During the colonial period, most West African countries concentrated on the production and 
marketing of one or two export (cash) crops: groundnuts in Senegal and Gambia; cocoa and 
palm kernels in Sierra Leone; palm oil and cocoa in Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire and Gold Coast 
(Ghana); and palm oil and kernels and cotton in Nigeria. West African economies were also 
structured to be permanently dependent on Western nations. They were consigned the role 
of primary producers for processing in the West. The terms of trade in the Western-
controlled international market discriminated against African nations who were unable to 
earn enough to develop their economies. The World Trade Organisation (WTO), for 
example, draws trade rules between nations and these rules are generally more favourable 
to the developed countries. Obtaining better terms for West African products in the 
international market has been very difficult. 
Also, the prices of agricultural goods have been falling in the international markets since the 
1970s. For example, the fluctuating price of cocoa in the 1970s and 1980s nearly ruined the 
Ghanaian economy, which is heavily dependent on cocoa exports. Côte d’Ivoire, also a 
major cocoa exporter, experienced similar difficulties. At the same time, the cost of 
imported goods continued to rise when the price of primary products was falling. The 
mining sector has also been plagued with difficulties. Almost all the major minerals in West 
Africa are mined by foreign companies and these companies generally have very favourable 
concessions. They pay little tax to the government and there is hardly any linkage between 
the mining sector and other sectors of the economy. 
West African countries have also been saddled with the debt burden. In their desire to 
provide needed services for their people and initiate capital projects, West Africa’s leaders 
resorted to massive borrowing with high interest rates, from abroad. Nkrumah took huge 
loans from the World Bank, the United States and Britain for the Akosombo hydro-electric 
project. The costs of construction soared far beyond the estimates. The result was to cripple 
Ghana, which was just emerging from colonial rule, with a huge foreign debt. By 1992, 
Ghana’s external debts stood at $30 billion. Practically every West African country has huge 
external and domestic debts and paying interest on these debts alone sometimes consumes 
an appreciable percentage of the country’s revenue. 
 
Authoritarian regimes 
West African rulers have generally abandoned the high ideals they had pronounced on 
assuming power. All of them, without exception, promised to uphold democratic values and 
principles and the rule of law. Very quickly, most resorted to autocratic rule and were very 
intolerant of opposing political views and opinions. They saw dissent or opposition as a 
threat to stability and an obstacle to development. They undermined the governance 
structures left behind by the colonialists and some instituted one-party regimes. 
Kwame Nkrumah, who had pioneered West African independence, led the way. Like many 
new African states, Ghana suffered from regional factionalism, and Nkrumah saw some 
strong economic groups like the wealthy farmers, who were regionally concentrated, as a 
danger to social unity. In 1964, faced with growing resentment and afraid of internal 
opposition, Nkrumah pushed a constitutional amendment that made Ghana a one-party 
state, and himself the life president. Thereafter, he became increasingly repressive and 
isolated himself from the common people. 
In Francophone West Africa, Houphouët-Boigy of Côte d’Ivoire and Sékou Touré of Guinea 
installed near single-party regimes even before formal independence. By the mid-1960s 
almost all the Francophone countries had instituted single-party governments. In 
Anglophone West Africa, Sierra Leone followed Ghana in 1978. Supporters of one-party rule 
put forward interesting but unconvincing arguments. 
1. Multi-party democracy was foreign to Africa. In precolonial Africa, they argued, 
people practised a single party form of government. 
2. There were limited human resources in the newly-independent countries and it was 
necessary, therefore, for everyone to come together for rapid socio-economic and 
political development. 
The political argument was not historically correct. There were no political parties in 
precolonial Africa. African kings and queens governed by consensus and there were several 
checks against tyrannical rule. These checks were totally absent in West Africa’s one-party 
systems. In practice, one party became one-person rule, for the parliaments simply 
rubberstamped the actions of the Executive President. 
Rather than promote inclusive politics, one party rule in essence fostered the politics of 
exclusion. It led to the marginalisation of whole groups and regions. One-partyism bred 
political injustice, disrupted the rule of law and corrupted principal state organs like the 
judiciary, military, police and the Civil Service. Under the one-party system, real or imagined 
enemies were eliminated by legal and extra-legal means. The system also rewarded 
sycophancy and punished honesty, hard work, patriotism and independent thought. One 
party rule thus contributed immensely to the underdevelopment of postcolonial West 
Africa. 
 
The military as political rulers 
Another major threat to development in West Africa has come from the military. Unlike 
Guinea-Bissau which fought a long war of independence against Portugal (1963-74), the 
armies in West Africa did not play any significant role in the liberation struggle. The 
colonialists had used the soldiers as instruments of suppression. They, together with the 
Police, often ruthlessly put down popular protests against colonial rule. Post-independence 
leaders generally viewed the military with some suspicion. 
Post-colonial West Africa has had more than its fair share of military coups. The 1960s were 
called the decade of coups in the sub-region. Once coups started they became like a wild 
Harmattan bushfire, sweeping through the entire sub-region. The coup syndrome began in 
Togo in January 1963, when the army deposed and killed President Sylvanus Olympio and in 
October of that year, the Chief of Staff of the Dahomeyan Army Christophe Sogho 
overthrew President Hubert Maga in order to prevent a civil war. Then it was Upper Volta’s 
turn. Following large-scale popular unrest in January 1966, Lieutenant-Colonel Sangoulé 
Lamizana deposed President Maurice Yaméogo. Nigerian army leader General Johnson 
Aguiyi-Ironsi seized power also in January 1966 and killed Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa. He 
too was overthrown and killed by General Yakubu Gowon in July that same year. In Ghana, 
Lieutenant-General Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka and other senior army officers toppled 
President Nkrumah in February 1966, when he was on a state visit to China. Nkrumah 
sought refuge in Conakry, Guinea where his friend Sékou Touré made him honorary co-
president of Guinea. Two years later in April 1968, lower-ranking military officers overthrew 
the National Reformation Council (NRC) junta of Sierra Leone and installed a civilian 
government headed by Siaka Stevens. In Mali, a young officer Lieutenant Moussa Traoré 
ousted the government of President Modibo Keita in November 1968. Since then, it has 
been one coup after the other. 
Why has the military been so quick in toppling civilian governments? There are various 
reasons. 
1. The failure of civilian governments to properly manage the affairs of state, which 
often results in severe political, economic and social problems for the people. 
Political repression including the arbitrary use of power, ethnic conflicts, economic 
mismanagement and corruption have sometimes been cited by the army for their 
intervention. 
2. The ineffectiveness of the central government in the face of crisis situations, such as 
bitter party or inter–regional rivalry. The 1966 coup in Upper Volta led by General 
Lamizana is a typical example. 
3. The refusal of governments to allow peaceful political change through the ballot box 
or through other constitutional channels. 
4. When the army as an institution feels threatened by the actions of the central 
government. This perceived or real threat partly explains the motive for the 1997 
military coup in Sierra Leone. Top army officers resented the right-sizing of the army 
and the high-profile role of the civil militia (especially the Kamajors) in the 
prosecution of the civil war, which began in March 1991. 
5. Greed/selfishness on the part of the soldiers. 
 
Results of military coups 
1. Little regard for the National Constitution: As soon as a civilian government is 
overthrown, the military junta puts aside the Constitution, proscribes all political 
activities and rules by decree. This is a very undemocratic behaviour on the part of 
the military rulers. 
2. Human rights abuses: Military rulers have little regard for the rights and freedoms of 
the individual. The arbitrary arrest, detention and killings of politicians and others 
connected with the ousted regime and massive destruction or looting of property 
are disturbing features of military rule. 
3. The fallacy of rescuing the state: In the majority of the coups that have occurred, the 
military has sometimes deemed it a national and patriotic obligation to rescue the 
country from total collapse and restore lost national prestige. But this is not always 
the case. Most military regimes have turned out to be more corrupt, oppressive and 
self-seeking than the civilian governments they toppled. 
4. Broken promises: Military regimes have tended to quickly forget their initial 
proclamations. These include cleaning up the mess the politicians left behind, 
improving the economic and social conditions of the people, and returning to the 
barracks within the shortest possible time. In the majority of cases, military leaders 
have converted themselves into civilian dictators through manipulation of the 
democratic system and flawed elections; a good example is the rise to power of 
Yahya Jammeh in The Gambia as an elected president, following the initial coup in 
1994. 
Two notable military junta leaders who attempted to save their countries from total 
collapse were Flight Lieutenant Jerry J Rawlings of Ghana and Colonel Thomas Sankara of 
Upper Volta. Rawlings staged a successful coup on 31 December 1981. His first coup 
attempt in 1979 had failed. The 1981 coup was staged in the wake of severe social and 
economic conditions in Ghana. Ruling by decree, Rawlings streamlined the economy and 
revived critical sectors like the transport system and the factories, which had become idle 
for many years. He achieved substantial economic gains, but at a considerable social price, 
in high unemployment, reduced medical and social services and cuts in educational ex-
penditure, in line with the International Monetary Fund’s prescriptions. These austerity 
measures hit especially the urban populace very hard. Students and workers protested, but 
Rawlings was resolute to push through his reform policies. Rawlings subsequently removed 
his military uniform and became a civilian politician. He formed the National Democratic 
Congress (NDC) in 1992, legalised political parties and organised presidential and 
parliamentary elections, which he won. President Rawlings retired in 2001 after serving two 
consecutive terms as provided for in the Ghanaian Constitution. 
Thomas Sankara seized power in 1983 in a popularly-supported coup. He desired to 
eradicate corruption and French dominance in Upper Volta. He renamed the country 
Burkina Faso (“Land of Upright Men”) and embarked on aggressive economic and social 
policies designed to make Burkina Faso self-reliant. A small but powerful class in Burkina 
Faso in league with outsiders, plotted Sankara’s downfall. He was assassinated in a coup led 
by one of his close friends, Blaise Compaoré in 1987. Compaoré, who was very friendly with 
the French, reversed many of Sankara’s policies and reforms.

In general, military rule in West Africa has been disappointing. Apart from their inability to 
solve the political, social and economic problems the soldier-rulers set out to tackle in the 
first place, the behaviour of the military once in power, has not been very different from the 
civilian politicians they overthrew. Soldiers have been known to be more of wealth-seekers, 
property grabbers and bribe-takers. They have openly engaged themselves in self-
enrichment activities through the barrel of the gun and through intimidation. General Sani 
Abacha of Nigeria was known to have embezzled millions of dollars of his country’s money. 
 
Problems of unemployment, under-employment and civil wars 
All West African countries, without exception, have had serious employment problems and 
the youth have been the greatest victims. Between 60 and 75 per cent of the population of 
most West African countries consists of young people. The youth are able-bodied but 
unskilled, jobless and alienated. They pose grave security and political challenges because 
they are ready and willing to take up arms in exchange for cash, recognition, looted 
property and “wives”. They live in appalling slum conditions in the vastly expanding cities of 
the sub-region and constitute potential material for mob action in times of political and 
economic crises. 
West Africa’s youths are also highly mobile and cross-border recruitment of young people 
for armed conflict is all too common. In the civil wars that have plagued West Africa since 
the last quarter of the 20th century, the youth have been the main perpetrators of violence 
and bloodshed. These deadly conflicts have resulted in: 
1. the massive destruction of lives and property; 
2. the internal displacement of people; 
3. a region-wide refugee crisis, poverty and disease; 
4. the proliferation of small arms and light weapons; 
5. human and drug trafficking and 
6. illegal exploitation of natural resources and banditry. 
The causes of these wars include poverty, youth unemployment, human rights violations, 
bad governance and corruption, ethnic marginalisation and small arms proliferation. Two 
fairly recent internal deadly conflicts that have gravely impacted the overall development of 
their countries are the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia. 
 
The wars in Liberia 
Liberia plunged into its first nasty civil war in 1989 with the invasion of Charles Taylor’s 
National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). The war had its origins in 1980 when Master 
Sergeant Samuel Kanyon Doe’s ethnically-inspired bloody coup overthrew President William 
Tolbert’s True Whig party government. The True Whig party, comprising predominantly of 
Americo-Liberians, had governed Liberia since independence in 1847, to the near exclusion 
of the other groups. The coup leader-turned-president Doe became increasingly 
authoritarian and corrupt. He quickly lost the support he had initially gained. Taylor, whose 
father was an Americo-Liberian, had held a very lucrative position in the Doe administration 
but was sacked in May 1983 for embezzlement. He later escaped from a prison in the USA, 
went to Libya and with support from Libya, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire, launched a 
rebellion against Doe in December 1989. 
Although Doe was eliminated by the leader of another rebel group, the civil war dragged on. 
With the active intervention of the West African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, which had 
been put together in the wake of the Liberian civil war, the violence abated, leading to a 
ceasefire and elections. Taylor won the 1997 elections and became President, but this 
seeming peace was short-lived as longstanding and simmering ethnic tensions, corruption, 
subjugation and abject poverty of the people thrust the country back into a second civil war 
in 1999. During the five-year war, the country was besieged by violent confrontations 
between Taylor’s NPFL, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and 
the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL). 
The signing of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2003 led to the attainment of 
appreciable peace and stability in Liberia. International pressure forced Charles Taylor to 
resign as President on 11 August 2003, as he was perceived to be the main perpetuator of 
the violence in his country. Taylor went on exile to Nigeria but was later apprehended and 
tried by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for his role in the Sierra Leone rebel war. The trial 
took place in The Hague (Netherlands). Taylor was found guilty and is currently serving a 50-
year jail term in Britain. 
 
Rebel war in Sierra Leone 
Less than two years after the outbreak of the Liberian civil war, violent conflict erupted in 
neighbouring Sierra Leone in March 1991, and was led by a cashiered officer, Foday Sankoh, 
who desired to overthrow the APC civilian government led by Major General Joseph Saidu 
Momoh. Sankoh’s rebellious group was called Revolutionary United Front (RUF). Sankoh 
received considerable military and logistics support from Charles Taylor, Libya and Burkina 
Faso. During the decade-long war, his fighters intermittently took control of the diamond 
mining regions. They sold the diamonds through Charles Taylor to buy more weapons (blood 
diamonds) to continue their war of annihilation. ECOMOG troops assisted the Sierra Leone 
army to put down the rebellion. 
The Sierra Leone Army seized power on 29 April 1992 in protest against appalling conditions 
in the battlefield. They then set up a National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) with 26-year 
old Captain Valentine Strasser as Chairman. Under pressure from the international 
community and Sierra Leonean groups, the NPRC conducted presidential and parliamentary 
elections in 1996 and peacefully handed over office to a newly-elected government headed 
by a retired United Nations official Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of the SLPP. 
Despite the elections, the war dragged on. Lacking little national support but dangerously 
armed, the RUF resorted to committing gross human rights violations against defenceless 
Sierra Leoneans. After several peace agreements interspersed by another military coup from 
May 1997 to April 1998, the war was officially declared over in February 2002. Meanwhile, 
rebel leader Foday Sankoh and two of his key commanders, and civil militia and junta 
leaders had been apprehended and faced charges in the Special Court for Sierra Leone. 
Sankoh and a civil militia leader Hinga Norman, died in detention, while the other accused 
men were found guilty and given long prison sentences to be served in Rwanda. 
The rebel conflict, arising from corruption, bad governance, social injustice, and breakdown 
of democratic institutions, resulted in the killing and maiming of about 50,000 people, and 
the wanton destruction of infrastructure and other important social services. 
 
Other insurgencies 
There have also been revolts affecting Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea 
Bissau and Senegal. The prolonged Niger Delta conflict in Nigeria first arose in the early 
1990s over tensions between foreign oil corporations and a number of the Niger Delta’s 
minority ethnic groups, particularly the Ogoni and Ijaw. The Niger Delta groups seemed to 
benefit very little from the oil economy, while their land was being polluted and their 
economic activities seriously disrupted by the operations of the oil companies. The conflict 
has led to several kidnappings of expatriates, casualties and the increased use of 
sophisticated weaponry by militant groups such as the Movement for the Emancipation of 
the Niger Delta (MEND), thereby heightening insecurity within Nigeria and across the sub-
region. 
The Boko Haram insurgency which began in northern Nigeria in 2002 and which hinges upon 
religion and economic deprivation, has claimed many lives, displaced thousands of people 
and posed security concerns in the sub-region. Ending wars and conflicts in West Africa has 
been very difficult, due to their complex multiple causes, multiple actors and the nature of 
the conflicts. 
 
Unequal development within states and boundary disputes 
One negative outcome of the artificiality and arbitrariness of the colonial divisions was that 
the states that were created were of different sizes with unequal natural resources and 
economic potentialities. Mali and Nigeria emerged as very large countries, in comparison to 
Gambia, Sierra Leone, Togo and Benin. Some, like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, are 
landlocked and relatively poor and so economic and social progress is slow and difficult in 
these countries. The artificial boundaries have occasionally led to border disputes, for 
example, between Ghana and Togo, between Sierra Leone and Guinea (the Yenga dispute) 
and between Nigeria and Cameroon (in the Bakassi Peninsular) which have worsened the 
relations between the conflict countries. 
 
Population explosion, diseases and drought 
Uncontrolled population growth has proved to be one of the most important barriers to 
economic development in post-independent West Africa. It has contributed to massive 
migration to the urban areas. Cities like Lagos, Accra, Abidjan, Freetown, Dakar and many 
others have grown enormously since independence. These cities spread without planning 
and developed vast slums. They also lacked expanding industrial sectors able to utilise the 
rural migrants. Consequently, these migrants formed the urban underclass. 
Another serious impediment to development in West Africa is disease. Tropical diseases like 
malaria and yellow fever prevail and they have seriously impacted the productive capacity 
of especially rural and poor people. In the 1980s, the AIDS epidemic was added to an 
already gloomy picture. 
There is also the problem of drought in the Sahel countries, which began in the late 1960s. 
Drought has been caused mainly by the expansion of the Sahara Desert and human 
activities. Long periods of drought badly hit Senegal, Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger 
and northern Nigeria. With little or no rain sometimes for years, crops and animals perished. 
Drought led to famine. Many people died of malnutrition, lack of resistance to diseases and 
hunger. Coping with the drought situation diverted considerable portions of the already 
meagre resources of the drought-stricken West African countries to drought relief. 
 
Corruption and mismanagement 
Large-scale corruption and mismanagement of public funds have also been key barriers to 
progress and security in the West African sub-region. Corruption has thrived best in 
countries where critical institutions like Parliament, the judiciary and civil society are weak, 
and where political patronage is standard practice. People engage in corrupt practices 
because of low salaries, poverty and greed. There are many types or manifestations of 
corruption. 
 
Grand or political corruption 
It involves higher level officials and larger sums of money. This may include kickbacks to win 
big public procurements or contracts, embezzlement of public funds, and companies paying 
thousands of dollars to government leaders or politicians to obtain business contracts. The 
main players of grand corruption are normally state ministers, governors, members of 
parliament, and even presidents. 
 
State capture 
State capture refers to a situation whereby some powerful individuals (called god fathers) 
support a political party so that they can influence the policies and decisions of that party 
(such as ministerial or ambassadorial appointments, or the award of big contracts) when it is 
in power. 
 
Administrative or petty corruption 
Administrative or petty corruption describes everyday low-level abuse of power that citizens 
and businesspeople experience within the state bureaucracy, such as demand for small 
bribes or gifts before certain services, which are supposed to be free, are rendered. 
 
Effects of corruption 
Corruption, whether grand or petty, is unethical and unacceptable as it affects the smooth 
running of society. 
1. It undermines social values because people find it easier and more lucrative to 
engage in corruption than to seek legitimate employment. 
2. It limits economic growth because corruption reduces the amount of public 
resources and impedes the efficient use of government revenue and development 
assistance funds. 
3. It discourages private investment. 
4. Corruption increases the costs of doing business and wastes resources. It also results 
in poor service delivery. 
5. Corruption deepens poverty and makes it difficult for ordinary people to get ahead 
as the result of their own efforts. Corruption affects the poor badly, who not only 
suffer from the lack of services and efficient government, but who are also 
powerless to resist the demands of corrupt officials. 
6. It perverts the cause of justice. Corruption in the police and the judiciary 
compromises the rule of law. 
7. Corruption endangers the security of the state as corrupt border guards allow 
weapons and other dangerous goods to pass freely. 
 
In the 1970s and 1980s especially, West African countries were forced to take huge loans 
from lending institutions like the IMF, in the face of severe economic and social conditions 
in their countries. The IMF was convinced at the time that economic and social progress in 
West Africa was slow because its leaders maintained a huge and unproductive workforce, 
wasted money on uneconomic projects and poorly managed their economies. A necessary 
condition for receiving IMF loans was for each recipient country to take concrete steps to 
right-size its work force, prudently manage the economy and drastically cut down on social 
expenditure. These reforms were called Structural Adjustment. One negative effect of 
reducing social expenditure was that the provision of social services like schools and 
hospitals declined massively, thereby negatively impacting the living standards of the 
people. 
 
Conclusion 
Post-colonial West African countries have made considerable progress since independence. 
They have improved social services and expanded the infrastructure considerably. However, 
most countries in the sub-region have not made as much progress as was expected at 
independence. There are still huge problems and until West Africa’s leaders in concert with 
their citizens take strong measures to solve these problems, West Africa will find it difficult 
to catch up with the rest of the world.

10 - West Africa and International Organizations 
 
Since the end of the Second World the nations of the world have worked together to ensure 
that the catastrophe that this war brought to humankind is never repeated. It was out of 
such a context that international bodies such as the United Nations Organization (UN) were 
created to foster peace and stability in the world. The UN’s mandate and structure has since 
the early 1960s also spawned similar associations in Africa including the continental 
Organisation of African Unity (OAU), its successor Africa Union (AU), and half a dozen other 
sub-regional bodies such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and 
its peace keeping arms, the ECOWAS Ceasefire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). 
It’s also important to recognize other kinds of international organizations and the 
relationship of West Africa to them. These include big NGOs such as Oxfam and MSF, and 
also private foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All these 
organisations together relate in different ways to West Africa’s relationships to the world. 
 
West Africa and the UN 
The UN Charter which sets out the role, structure and vision of the body came into force in 
October 1945. The UN set out to ‘maintain international peace and security’; ‘develop 
friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-
determination of peoples’; ‘achieve international co-operation in solving international 
problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character’ and be a centre for 
harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends’. These are 
ideals which every member country has to abide by in theory and practice. 
The links between the UN and West Africa started with Liberia’s entry as a full member in 
November 1945. Indeed, in many ways Liberia can proudly regard itself as one of the 
founding members of the UN as it was the only African country at the time which was fully 
independent and sovereign. In 1957, Ghana was admitted into the UN few months after she 
gained her independence from Britain. Guinea-Conakry joined soon after she threw out the 
French colonial rulers in October 1958. Nigeria joined the UN in 1960, Sierra Leone in 1961 
and Gambia in 1965. 
Yet, West African countries soon made their mark on the UN in various ways. In 1960 for 
example, Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah made a poignant and highly praised speech 
at the UN General Assembly at which he stated clearly his wish for Africa to be treated as an 
equal partner in the comity of nations, suggesting that ‘a permanent seat should be created 
for Africa on the Security Council in view not only of the growing number of African 
members of the United Nations, but also of the increasing importance of the African 
continent in world affairs’. Nkrumah was also instrumental in the UN sending a peace 
keeping force into the Congo in the summer of 1960 to help put an end to a secessionist 
movement in Katanga (southern DRC, rich in copper) instigated by the ex-colonial power 
Belgium. Ghana, Guinea, Liberia were among the countries which contributed forces to that 
peace keeping force. 
West African countries continued to contribute to the development of the UN in other ways 
such as diplomacy. Ghanaian diplomat Dr. Robert Gardiner was assistant UN Secretary 
General for many years; while Sierra Leonean diplomat and scholar Dr. Davdison Nicol also 
occupied such post in the 1960s. In 1964, Ghana’s Alex Quayson Sackey became the first 
African to be elected President (chair) of the UN General Assembly and won much praise for 
the efficiency and decorum he brought to this apex body of the organization. 
Other West African diplomats such as Ms. Angie Brooks (Liberia); Amara Essy (Ivory Coast), 
Joseph Garba (Nigeria) also had the singular honour of being elected president of the 25 
member UN Security Council. To crown the achievements of West Africans in the UN, Dr 
Kofi Annan from Ghana was elected UN Secretary General in 1996 and served two full 
terms.

West African countries also benefit from the UN through the multilateral support offered by 
UN bodies such as United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), 
especially for support in teacher training and cultural activities; the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) in seed variety improvement and irrigation; and the United Nations 
Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) which supports child care activities. 
West Africa and the OAU/AU 
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was formed in May 1963 by the independent 
African countries to serve as a platform where African states could enhance unity and 
cooperation, stand together to remove the vestiges of colonialism in the continent and to 
end apartheid (racial segregation) rule in South Africa, minority rule in then Rhodesia, and 
Portuguese colonial rule, which continued in its colonies until 1974. These were noble 
objectives and at the time also very appropriate and timely because the newly independent 
states were drifting apart into numerous power blocks which threatened to bring disunity 
among them. 
For example, at independence in the 1960s the continent was divided into political blocs 
namely the: 
Monrovia group: Liberia, Nigeria, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Ethiopia, Senegal 
Casablanca group: Ghana, Mali, Guinea, Morocco, Egypt, Libya, 
Brazzaville group: Congo (Brazzaville), Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mauritania, Upper Volta, Niger, 
Dahomey (Benin), Chad, Gabon, the Central African Republic, Cameroun and Madagascar. 
Each of these groupings pulled in different directions and their rulers were not hesitant to 
pour vitriol on one another in public, including at the UN General Assembly. 
The Congo conflict of September 1960 to 1965; Nigerian Independence in 1960 which led to 
the start of the unhealthy Ghana-Nigeria rivalry for regional dominance, and the Mauritania-
Morocco border dispute of 1960, were some of the factors for this fissure. Neo-colonial 
intrigues were of course also at full play as the ex-colonial masters sought to exert overt 
control over their former colonies. 
Indeed by October 1960, all of independent Africa was divided into these blocs. There was a 
great risk of further Balkanization of the continent instead of unity as espoused by the Pan 
African spirit sowed a few years earlier. Add to this cleavage collapse of the Mali Federation 
in 1960, which brought together Senegal and Mali in short-lived unity, and the despair 
mounted among Pan Africanists of Africa ever uniting. 
The political blocs persisted and of course pleased the detractors, mainly former colonial 
masters, who revelled in the looming prospect of a divided and weakened Africa unable to 
take its proper place as a powerful counter force to neo-colonialism and imperialism. For 
the spirit of Pan-Africanism to be restored, these blocs had to be merged into one super 
continental organisation dedicated to building a single African voice. 
Hope was restored albeit gradually. In 1961 independent African countries met with other 
emerging Third World countries in Yugoslavia to form the Non Aligned Movement, a strong 
body which sought to clear away from either the western or eastern blocs involved in the 
Cold War. The new organization became a meeting point for all the three main African 
blocs, and helped nudge African states to form a united front, especially against colonialism 
and apartheid. 
Other factors why African leaders decided to end the bloc system was the spate of foreign 
inspired coups against newly independent African states, the rise and strengthening of 
apartheid in South Africa, and the emergence of anti-colonial wars in Portuguese colonies. 
The rise of the Civil Rights movement in the USA and diplomatic efforts of Emperor Haile 
Sellasie of Ethiopia also helped to coalesce African leaders into one group called the OAU 
formed on May 25 1963. 
A second achievement of the Pan African spirit, aside ending colonial rule on the continent, 
is therefore the establishment of the OAU. Soon the OAU became the single most important 
vanguard towards realising the aims and aspirations of the Pan African project. The OAU 
soon established a Liberation Committee and Fund which sought to assist liberation 
movement to remove all forms of colonial rule in Africa. Indeed, by 1975 all of Africa except 
South Africa,Namibia and Zimbabwe was free of foreign rule. The OAU also united Africans 
in the fight against apartheid in South Africa by requiring its member states to have nothing 
to do with South Africa and insisting on economic and cultural boycott of the apartheid 
state, in addition to the assistance it gives to the ANC and other anti apartheid forces 
through the Liberation Fund. The release of Mandela in 1990 and the end of White minority 
rule in 1994 were indeed the apotheosis of OAU success. 
But the OAU was unable to achieve its prime objective of forging unity leading to the 
proverbial United States of Africa which is why in 2000, African leaders met in Sirte Libya to 
re-orient the OAU into a new body called the African Union (AU) which seeks to work 
towards achieving continental unity. Now that Africa did not have the odious apartheid 
regime or colonialism to worry about in the continent, it was deemed timely to move faster 
towards unity. This is why the AU has a Pan-African Parliament based in Cape Town, South 
Africa, a Peace and Security Council and a Human Rights Commission among other organs. 
These organs are tasked with the formulation of laws, maintenance of peace and stability 
and ensuring the protection of basic human rights on the continent. Various West African 
countries such as Gambia (2006), Nigeria (2003) have hosted the AU twice a year summits of 
heads of state. Alpha Omar Konare of Mali and Amara Essy of Ivory Coast had served as 
Chairpersons of the AU secretariat. Presidents Alpha Conde of Guinea (2017-2018); John 
Kufour of Ghana (2006-2007), and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria (2003-2004) had served a 
chairman of the AU Assembly of Heads of State. 
 
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) 
In May 1975, West African leaders under the chairmanship of President Yakubu Gowon of 
Nigeria met in Lagos to create a sub-regional economic and political organization which 
became known as ECOWAS. As the names suggests, this body was meant to serve as a 
catalyst to fast economic and monetary cooperation among the 15 states in West Africa 
such as free movement of goods and people. There were at the time divisions based on 
colonial history, since the French colonies had bequeathed a standard currency (the CFA) to 
their colonies, except for Guinea-Conakry. 
ECOWAS therefore, started with its stated mission to promote economic integration across 
the region. Another objective of ECOWAS is to foster ‘collective self-sufficiency for its 
member states by creating a single large trading bloc by building a full economic and trading 
union’. 
Visas were abolished for citizens visiting ECOWAS member states and trade barriers were 
removed between member states. However, the outbreak of the civil war in Liberia in 1989, 
compelled ECOWAS to expand its horizons beyond mere economic integration to peace 
keeping and the promotion of democracy and rule of law in member states. 
Consequently, in 1990 at its summit in Banjul, The Gambia, ECOWAS leaders agreed to form 
a peace keeping force called Ecowas Ceasefire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to help restore 
peace to Liberia. The success of ECOMOG in bringing about a ceasefire and restoration of 
democracy in Liberia encouraged ECOWAS leaders to retain ECOMOG as a permanent 
component of the organization and has since then intervened militarily to restore 
democracy in Sierra Leone (1998), Ivory Coast (2003), Guinea-Bissau(2012) and The 
Gambia(2017). ECOWAS has also created a Parliament, a Community Court of Justice and 
has declared zero tolerance for military coups and similar illegal seizures of power in order 
to boost the region’s (once the hotbed of army coups) democratic credentials.

Commonwealth and West Africa 
The Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone belong to the Commonwealth, the loose 
association of former British colonies which today boasts 52 member states. All members 
have an equal say – regardless of size or economic stature. This ensures even the smallest 
member countries have a voice in shaping the Commonwealth. All members subscribe to 
the Commonwealth’s values and principles outlined in The Commonwealth Charter. 
The core principles of the Charter are the respect for human rights, democratic values and 
the rule of law. Member states must be seen to be abiding by the spirit and letter of the 
Charter to retain their membership. Indeed, what unites Commonwealth member states 
besides the use of English language are these core values. 
Leaders of member countries shape Commonwealth policies and priorities. Every two years, 
they meet to discuss issues affecting the Commonwealth and the wider world at the 
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). Although Queen Elizabeth of 
England is head of the Commonwealth, this is rather a symbolic position than anything else. 
The Commonwealth Secretariat in London, led by a Secretary General, runs the daily affairs 
of the organization. A Nigerian diplomat Chief Emeka Anyouku was Secretary General from 
1990-2000. 
President Yahya Jammeh unilaterally withdrew The Gambia from the Commonwealth in 
October 2013. However, newly elected president Adama Barrow has pledged to return the 
country to the organisation in mid 2018. Ghanaian and Nigerian athletes have performed 
with distinction in the Commonwealth Games held every four years, while writers such as 
Ben Okri and the novelist Helon Habila (both from Nigeria) and the Sierra Leone poet Syl 
Cheney Coker have won the prestigious Commonwealth Writers Prize. 
 
Non-Aligned Movement and West Africa 
The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is a group of states that are not formally aligned with or 
against any major power bloc. As of 2012, the movement has 120 members, making it the 
second biggest international grouping apart from the UN. All African countries, except South 
Sudan, belong to the organization. Founded in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961, Presidents 
Nkrumah of Ghana and Sekou Toure of Guinea were among the founders of the 
organization which seeks to ensure ‘the national independence, sovereignty, territorial 
integrity and security of non-aligned countries’. 
The Movement was largely a product of the Cold War which pitted Soviet Communist bloc 
against the West. Members of the Movement claimed to be neutral in this US-Soviet Union 
struggle for domination and hegemony. 
The Movement supported members in their ‘struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-
colonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, 
interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics.’ 
The demise of the Cold War and the end of apartheid made the Movement to re-orient its 
position and now concentrates on issues such as reform of the UN Security Council, 
sustainable development, debt relief for poor countries and cultural rights. 
 
Organization of Islamic Conference/Cooperation (OIC) 
The Organization of Islamic Conference was formed in 1969 following the burning of the Al-
Asqa mosque, (the second most venerated mosque in Islam), in Jerusalem, Israel occupied 
Palestine by a deranged militant. The fire caused so much anger in the Muslim world that 
the grand Imam of Jerusalem called for an emergency meeting of Muslim heads of state to 
discuss the incident. This gathering of heads of state from mainly Arab speaking countries 
was birth of the OIC. Today it has 57 members including The Gambia, Sierra Leone and 
Nigeria. One key requirement for membership is that 30 per cent of the country’s 
population must profess to Islam as a religion. Its headquarters are in Jeddah, Saudia Arabia. 
The organisation sees itself as "the collective voice of the Muslim World" and works to 
"safeguard and protect the interests of the Muslim world in the spirit of promoting 
international peace and harmony’. The OIC aims to preserve Islamic social and economic 
values; promote solidarity amongst member states; and uphold international peace and 
security. It also works in advancing education, particularly in the fields of science and 
technology through its arm called Islamic Science, Education, Cultural Organization (ISESCO). 
Unlike the UN or the Commonwealth, OIC does not promote issues of democracy and 
human rights in its member’s states. This is why it usually comes under attack from human 
rights organizations who accuse it of shielding its members such as Iran and Saudi Arabia 
who have very poor human rights records, from critical appraisal. But the OIC still mobilizes 
international opinion against the Israeli atrocities against the Palestinians. West African 
countries like Senegal have played key roles in the OIC. In 2008, Dakar, hosted the OIC 
summit; during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988, Gambian president Sir Dawda Jawara was 
chairman of the OIC peace mission tasked with bringing peace between the two 
neighbouring OIC members. The OIC was renamed Organization of Islamic Cooperation in 
2011. In 2019, The Gambia will be hosting the OIC summit. 
 
NGOs: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 
Many international NGOs are now present in West Africa, working alongside the established 
and very effective local NGOs. Their role is contested, as in some cases they have intervened 
directly to fund political campaigns (as was the case recently with Oxfam in Senegal). In 
other cases, they can have a role in health emergencies, as has been the case with the Ebola 
epidemic of 2014. 
Private foundations are also involved. One example is the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation. Also called the Gates Foundation, it is a private humanitarian foundation 
founded by computer mogul and billionaire Bill Gates and his wife Melinda in 2000. The 
couple have used a significant part of their wealth to respond to urgent international health 
and social crises such as malaria control, Aids prevention and polio vaccination. The 
foundation also has a strong objective of fighting poverty and improving girls’ access to 
education. 
Through its flagship support programme called the Global Fund Against Tuberculosis Aids 
and Malaria(GFATM) West African countries have been able to reduced by half malaria and 
Aids infection in their countries. Nigeria recently received US dollars 76 million from the 
foundation to pay for anti-polio vaccination campaigns in the North of the country where 
the diseases remains prevalent. 
 
Conclusion 
While membership of these organizations continue to benefit countries in West Africa, lack 
of funding hampers the smooth operations of bodies like the UN and the AU. Another 
hindrance facing the smooth running of these organizations is their domination by big 
powers as evident in the Veto power of the five Permanent members of the UN Security 
Council. Moreover, increasingly these organization are being criticized for being 
bureaucratic and wasteful and for their inability to remain relevant to pressing issues of 
today such as religious radicalism, youth unemployment and the spread of diseases such as 
Ebola.

11 - Women and Authority in West African History 
 
Authority is the power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience. This 
chapter explores the political authority of West Africa women and the spiritual female 
principle in the precolonial and colonial eras. A longue durée perspective on gender 
relations in precolonial West Africa illuminates a history of gender parity and, at times, 
women’s authority over men. This history has been obscured by Western patriarchal 
ideologies—which imagined West African women as “beasts of burden,” women who were 
sold to the highest bidder for the productive and reproductive labor; in short, they imagined 
a West African woman that never was—and more recent historical processes, particularly 
the integration of West African societies into broader international mercantile networks and 
the ensuing establishment of formal colonial rule. 
The starting premise of this chapter, therefore, is that during these precolonial times, West 
African women as a whole were never, as some scholars have argued, subjected to 
patriarchal forces that subjugated and subordinated them to men. Furthermore, West 
African women were not passive, but active participants in the making of their own 
histories. They played significant roles in their societies’ religious, political, social, and 
economic processes; exhibiting control over key aspects therein. Indeed, West African 
women and the spiritual female principle, during the long precolonial period, had the power 
and right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience; in short, they had 
authority. Female political leaders were as common as male rulers; and women, and the 
female political principle, were central to the seamless functioning of their societies. This 
right, however, would be contested and tested during the colonial period, resulting in the 
systematic wrenching away of that power—the removal of women and the female spiritual 
principle from the avenues of power and authority that they had previously occupied. West 
African women and the female spiritual principle, did not however, take this sitting down. 
They employed, and evolved their precolonial strategies of enforcing obedience, i.e. 
precolonial strategies of resistance, into new strategies for fighting for their rights. 
 
The West African World View 
In order to appreciate the ways in which West African women wield authority, one must 
first understand how West Africans conceptualize their worlds, and what it means to exhibit 
power and authority therein. West African peoples identify two worlds—the human or 
physical/visible world, and the non-human or spiritual/invisible world. These worlds are not 
separate; but like two half circles, or two halves of a kolanut, when connected, make up one 
continuous, complete, and whole West African world. Therefore, one cannot understand 
the West African world, nor appreciate West African history by focusing exclusively on the 
human physical realm. To do this would be only to tell one half of West African history. 
Likewise, one cannot understand, nor appreciate, West African women’s or gender history 
by focusing exclusively on the physical realm. 
Indeed, West African cosmological structures—which operate within a cyclical movement of 
time or a continuum—demand that we engage with them in order to address the totality of 
West African experience. Thus, any informed study about female political authority in West 
Africa, must necessarily engage the female political spiritual principle—those unseen forces 
that are constructed by West Africans as female, such as goddesses, medicines, masked 
spirits, oracles; as well as women, (read: human beings), who have been endowed with 
spiritual idiosyncrasies to interpret this unseen spiritual world; and whose authority is 
personified in the work of priestesses, diviners, spirit mediums, healers, and prophetesses. 
It must consider the multiplicity of female manifestations in both worlds. 
As mentioned earlier, West African people identify two worlds, the human or 
physical/visible world, which is made up of the heavens, earth, and waters; and the non-
human or spiritual/invisible world. The non-human world is the world which we cannot see. 
These two worlds are not separate, but connected, and make up one continuous, complete 
and whole West Africa world. The West African world is cyclical, or never- ending. This 
explains the West African belief in the never-ending cycle of life and in reincarnation. They 
believe that one is born, grows old, dies, and then is reborn. 
The visible world is a world of human beings, of natural forces and phenomena. The invisible 
world is a world of divine beings, of good and bad spirits, and departed ancestors. The 
visible and invisible worlds commune and interact with each other. 
West Africans believe that there are spirits all around them. These spirits are too many for 
one to even know. Therefore, West Africans have mediums (diviners, priests, priestesses) to 
help explain the universe. These are special human beings who are endowed with spiritual 
idiosyncrasies. 
The spiritual and human worlds are hierarchical. At the zenith of the spiritual world is God. 
God is neither male nor female. God is a combination and balance of male and female 
forces. Many West African peoples have different names for God. The Asante and Fanti of 
Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, call God, Nyame. The Bambara of Mali, call God, Jalang; the Dogon 
of Burkina Faso and Mali, call the Great God, Amma. The Edo of Nigeria, call God, Osa. The 
Ewe of Benin, Ghana, and Togo, call God, Mawu. Among the Fon of Benin, God is called, 
Mawu-Lisa. The Ibibio of Nigeria, call God, Abassi and Chuku. The Igbo of Nigeria, call God, 
Chukwu, Chineke, and Olisa bi n’igwé. The Kpelle of Liberia, call God, Yala. The Mossi of 
Burkina Faso, call God, Winnam. The Nupe of Nigeria, call God, Soko and Waqa. The Vai of 
Liberia, call God, Kamba; and the Yoruba of Nigeria call God, Olodumare, Olorun, or Olofin-
Orun.

God is too great to behold and therefore is assisted by a pantheon of more accessible lesser 
gods and goddesses. These gods and goddesses are autonomous, yet interdependent. They 
are personifications of natural phenomena. Thus, West Africans have goddesses of the 
lands, gods of lightning and thunder; and, goddesses of the streams and rivers. The Yoruba 
goddess of the waters and love is oshun. The Igbo goddess of the lands is ani, and the Fon 
goddesses of fertility and harvests is legba. 
Moreover, the West African world view is reflective of a balance of male and female 
principles, meaning that when there is a male god, that male god is served by a female 
priestess. Likewise, when there is a female goddess, a male priest serves the goddess. 
Underneath the gods and goddess are the oracles. Oracles in West Africa can be both male 
and female. They are forces that explain the past and predict the future. Ibiniukpabi also 
known as the Arochukwu Long Juju by the British was an oracle in whose power was felt 
throughout the Nigerian Niger Delta region. And so powerful was she that the British 
ordered a series of patrols to attempt to destroy her. 
Ancestors are the dead, who have come back to life. They represent the never-ending cycle 
of life. When West Africans pour libation, they do so to invite their ancestors to be present 
during important times. In many West African nations, ancestors assume the physical form 
of masquerades or masked spirits. 
The human West African world is essentially made up of two types of societies—centralized 
and small-scale societies. Kings and queens (queen mothers) rule over centralized societies; 
and male and female elders rule over small scale societies. In West Africa men and women 
take titles to demonstrate their achievement. Warriors in West Africa can be both male and 
female, including the Amazons warriors from ancient Dahomey kingdom. The work ethic is 
extremely important in West Africa. All able-bodied men and women work; and as such, 
there are no stay-at-home West African mothers. Those able-bodied men and women who 
choose not work in West Africa are considered useless people because they are not 
contributing to society. So disregarded are they that they feature at the very bottom of 
societal hierarchy; even more disregarded than West African slaves. 
 
Politics in West Africa: The Precolonial Era 
In West Africa, religion and politics have always been interconnected. This is reflected in the 
fact that most West African rulers—kings, queens, and chiefs—have ruled by divine right. 
Many are able to trace their ancestry back, through oral histories, to a semi-divine figure. 
The Nigerian Yoruba for instance believe that Oduduwa began life as a deity and then 
became the first King, or Ooni of Ife. 
This section investigates the central and evolving place of West African women, as well as 
the female spiritual principle in precolonial politics by exploring the complexities of female 
political action in precolonial West Africa. It does this by dividing male and female 
politicking in precolonial West Africa into two broad analytical categories, namely, the 
human political constituency, and spiritual political constituency. The human political 
constituency is further divided into two complementary categories: female government and 
male government. Likewise, as discussed above, the spiritual political constituency is also 
divided into two: female government and male government. 
Leadership and power were not alien to West Africa women in pre-colonial society. Their 
position was complementary, rather than subordinate, to that of men. Political power and 
authority was divided between West African men and women in what has been described as 
a dual-sex political system in which each sex managed and controlled their own affairs. 
West African societies recognize two political constituencies, the spiritual and the human. 
The spiritual political constituency in West Africa consists of divinities, male and female 
functionaries who derived political power from an association with spiritual world. The 
human political constituency in West Africa is made up of executives who achieve political 
potential as human actors in physical realm. 
 
Female Power in the Spiritual Political Constituency: Case Study of the Igbo of Nigeria 
The female spiritual political constituency in West Africa of medicines, goddesses, 
priestesses, masked spirits or masquerades, and diviners figured as political heads in Igbo 
communities. Female masked spirits featured prominently as judicial courts and judges of 
moral conduct. They were the dead who had come back to life in the life of the community. 
For instance, among the eastern Nigerian Igbo, the female night masquerade, Abere, came 
out only at night and was said to carry all good luck and curses in her market pan. At the 
dead of night, she moved about acting as a night guard. Her presence was detected by a 
myriad of gruesome sounds—disagreeable music, screams, screeches and curses—that 
accompanied her wherever she went. Abere often sang an awe-inspiring song that charged 
Obukpa citizenry to behave themselves for—“Abere kills the husband, takes the wife captive 
and also takes captive the man who marries the woman whom she has taken captive.” She 
also visited homesteads and openly disclosed and lampooned the nefarious activities of 
particular community members. No secret was safe from Abere. In the precolonial era 
Abere operated as an integral part of the legal system and actively functioned as an agent of 
social control. She had the power and authority to order humans without challenge and her 
decrees and punishments were uncontestable. She was a strict disciplinarian who handed 
down tough sentences and visited anyone whose activities were considered a threat to 
community wholeness with sickness—chronic sores and mental illness—and if necessary, 
death. Abere also functioned as a community court, pronouncing judgments in cases 
brought before her and collecting retributions from offenders. As an embodiment of a dead 
woman, Abere particularly promoted and protected women’s industry (marketing and trade 
especially), and men were said to fear her pronouncements. 
 
Female Power in the Human Political Constituency: Queen Mothers in the Government and 
Politics of Asanteland, Ghana 
Government and politics in Asanteland was organized along a complimentary basis between 
the sexes. Some scholars have called this a dual-sex political system. Therefore, the Asante, 
had male and female government. Queen mothers were women co-rulers of Asanteland. 
They derived their power from the matrilineal nature of social organization. The Asante 
have a saying that “it is woman who gave birth to a man, it is a woman who gave birth to a 
chief.” Queen mothers determined succession, inheritance, rights, obligations and 
citizenship. 
 
Governmental Structure 
At the very top of the centralized government were the Asantehemma or queen mother, 
and Asantehene or king. Under these leaders were the queen mothers and kings of the 
paramounts, the female, Ohemaa and the male, Omanhene. The Ohemaa was the co-ruler 
who had joint responsibility with the male chief in all affairs of the state. Under the 
divisional areas are the towns, which are governed by their own queen mother called Oba 
Panin, and male chief Odikro. Under the towns are the eight clans of Asanteland, which are 
governed by sub female chiefs called, Abusuapanyin. 
Responsibilities and Obligations of the Queen Mothers 
Asante Queen Mothers exercised authority in many domains. The most important duty 
however was her responsibilities with regards to the king. First and foremost, the Asante 
Queen Mother elects the king. She is the royal genealogist who determines the legitimacy of 
all claimants to the vacant stool. When a king’s stool becomes vacant, the Asantehemma 
nominates a candidate for the Golden Stool. She has three chances to nominate a candidate 
who must be approved by the traditional council.

The Queen Mother guides and advises the king, in all matters of state, tradition and religion. 
She ensures that taboos are not breached, and she is the only one who has the right to 
criticize and rebuke the King in public. She is a member of the governing council or the 
assembly of state; and the queen mother’s presence is required whenever important 
matters of state are to be decided. 
The Queen Mother also had judicial responsibilities. She has her own separate court in her 
palace where she was assisted by female counselors and functionaries. She hears all judicial 
cases involving the sacred oaths of the state and has independent jurisdiction over all 
domestic matters affecting women and members of the royal family. In certain cases, male 
litigants could apply to have their civil cases transferred from king’s court to the queen 
mother’s court. If she accepts them, then her judgment is final. 
As Queen Mother, she is in charge of female governance, and brought women together to, 
for instance, clean the village. She performed important rituals for the community and was 
present during important ceremonies like funerals. It was the Queen Mother who 
performed all initiation rites; and all young women had to be brought to the queen mother 
once they started menstruating. Unlike most women, the Queen Mother married has right 
to have affairs with men in the kingdom. 
 
The Iyalode in Yoruba (Nigeria) Politics 
 The Iyalode, like the male chiefs of Yorubaland, was a chief in her own right. She had her 
own special insignia of office which consisted of a necklace of special beads, wide brimmed 
straw hats, and a shawl. The Iyalode had her own personal servants, special drummers, and 
bell ringers to call the women of the kingdom to attention. 
The Iyalode title was all embracing. She was given jurisdiction over all women. She was 
given the title Eiyelobinrin, “mother of all women.” The Iyadole was the chosen 
representative of all women. Her position was achieved, not inherited. 
The Iyalode office was an elective office that had to have stamp of popular approval. The 
most important qualification was the Iyalode’s proven ability as leader to articulate the 
feelings of the women of the kingdom. She controlled vast economic resources and was 
popular. Once appointed, the Iyalode became not only voice of women in government, but 
also, the queen who coordinated their activities. 
The Iyalode settled quarrels in court, and met with women to determine what women’s 
stand should be on such questions as the declaration of war, opening of new markets, and 
the administration of women at local levels. 
As spokeswoman of the women, the Iyalode was given access to all positions of power and 
authority within the State. She exercised legislative, judicial, and executive powers with 
male chiefs in their council. 
She had her own council of subordinate female chiefs who exercised jurisdiction over all 
matters that pertained to women. Her council of women chiefs were involved in the 
settlement of disputes between women, cleanliness of the markets, and other women’s 
concerns. The Iyalode also controlled the markets in the kingdom. She was the honorary 
president-general for all women’s societies in town. A great deal of what the Iyalode could 
achieve depended on the qualities of the Iyalode, her personality, dynamism, and political 
astuteness. 
 
Igbo Women in Community Politics 
There were two arms of government in the human political constituency in Igboland, the 
male and the female. Female government in Igboland was further divided into two arms, 
the otu umuada and the otu iyomdi. 
Igbo ancestral shrine Onica Olona, Northcote Whitridge Thomas (1914), Anthropological 
report on the Ibo-speaking peoples of Nigeria, Part IV. Harrison and Sons. Wikipedia. Public 
domain. 
The otu umuada 
The umuada included all married, unmarried, divorced, and widowed daughters of the 
lineage or community. Their meetings were held on rotational basis between the 
communities in which they married. The result was the creation of communication networks 
of women throughout Igboland. These networks made solidarity between women from vast 
areas possible during the Women’s War of 1929 or Ogu Umunwanyi. 
The duties of the otu umuada were many: 
1. They served as political pressure groups in their natal villages. 
2. They created unifying influences between their natal lineages and marital lineages. 
3. They settled disputes, intra lineage disputes and disputes between natal villages and 
villages in which they were married. 
4. They performed rites, rituals, and sacrifices for the community, including the final 
absolution rites for new brides. On the day in question, the bride-to-be would 
confess all her wrong doings to the otu umuada who would then purify her. 
5. The otu umuada also performed purification rituals for lineage houses and other 
areas that were considered polluted, so that the gods or goddesses would not leash 
out their wrath on the people, but instead, provide them with good health, bounty 
and offspring. 
6. The otu umuada heard confessions from adulterous wives and performed 
purification rituals for them. 
 
The otu inyomdi 
The otu inyomdi were wives of the village. Their leader, anasi, was the most senior wife in 
the community. She was the wife who was married longest in the community. The anasi 
was the medium through which the women could voice their concerns and protect their 
interests as wives, mothers, farmers, and traders. 
The duties of the otu inyomdi was many: 
1. They helped lineage wives in times of stress and illness. 
2. They heard and pronounced punishments in cases involving husbands who 
mistreated their wives. 
3. They made sure that the village stream and market place was clean. 
4. They made decisions involving the planting and harvesting of crops. 
5. They took care of animals that had destroyed their crops. 
 
Women’s Assembly 
From time to time in the life of the community, the otu umuada and otu inyomdi came 
together as the women’s assembly to discuss issues that affected them as women in the 
community. 
 
Ogbo associations or Age Grade associations 
Age grades were groups of women of same age, who came together in order to provide 
incentives toward ambition and hard work. They performed religious, social and political 
functions within the community; provided training for young people in group life; and 
provided avenues for socialization and companionship which were very useful and 
integrative factors in society. In Igboland, unmarried lineage daughters formed themselves 
into various ogbo associations. One of them was the okpo ntu and their duties included 
cleaning and maintaining the village latrines and garbage dumps; performing communal 
labor services such as house building and associated tasks; and, organizing themselves into 
dance groups, which provided forums where girls could build strong and lasting 
relationships with other girls in the group. 
 
Title Taking 
In Igboland status was achieved, not ascribed and a woman’s status was determined by her 
own achievements, not those of her husband. Igbo women could improve their social 
standing by taking titles. These titles included the ikenga, inachi and inwene. Titled women 
were accorded a lot of respect and those who showed leadership capabilities could often 
hold political office. 
 
The omu and her cabinet 
The omu and her cabinet of titled women councilors, ilogu, were charged with take care of 
the female section of the community. The market place was the Igbo woman’s domain. It 
was held every four days. The omu and her cabinet oversaw the market and defined its rules 
and regulations. The omu and her cabinet fixed the prices of market goods and defined 
market prohibitions. They acted as a court in the judging of cases and persecuting of wrong 
doers. The omu appointed a police woman called the awo. The awo implemented the fixed 
price regulations in the markets. She made sure market taboos were observed, and arrested 
wrongdoers and brought them before the omu court. Market taboos included, no fighting in 
the market, palm produce should not to be sold in bunches, but separated first; and last but 
not least, peppers should be boiled first before being sold. 
 
Strategies of female resistance in precolonial West Africa 
In the precolonial era, West African women gathered together to vocalize their feelings 
about situations that affected them. These meeting grounds also served as support 
networks that women could depend upon to exact punishment of offending men. 
What exactly would women do? First, they would request that whatever objectionable 
behavior stop. If it did not, the women’s groups would serve as ‘pressure groups’ which 
would exact punishments on the guilty party or parties. West African women’s group tactics 
included: the use of strikes, boycotts, force, nudity as protest, and “making war” or “sitting 
on a man.” “Making war” or “sitting on a man,” was the toughest measure that West African 
women employed for punishing wrongdoers and enforcing compliance to their rules and 
regulations. 
Strikes and boycotts often meant that West African women would ignore their household or 
marital responsibilities. For instance, West African women could “boycott” or abstain from 
sexual intercourse with their husbands. J. S. Harris reports on a case when a community of 
Igbo women repeatedly asked their clansmen to clear the paths leading to the market. 
When they did not, all the women in the village refused to cook for their husbands until 
they did. The boycott worked because all the women of the village cooperated. Husbands 
could not ask their mothers or sisters for food. 
A West African woman could enlist the support of other women in “making war” on an 
individual in a number of ways. The aggrieved woman could lodge a complaint at the market 
place or at one of the women’s gatherings. They could let out a traditional cry of grievance 
which would echo the village over. All the village women would gather at a common 
ground, the market place or the village square. Palm twigs would be passed around from 
woman to woman a symbol of the war to come. The women would dress in war gear, their 
heads bound with ferns and their faces smeared with ashes. They would then move with 
war-like precision, and gather at the offender’s compound. Once there, they would dance 
and sing derisive songs that outlined their grievances. Some of the songs called the 
manhood of the offender into question. They would bang on the offender’s door with their 
cooking pestles. Then they would skirt the offender’s compound and cover it with mud. On 
some occasions the women would destroy the house. They would pull the wrongdoer out 
and rough him up. They would surround him and then take turns in symbolically “sitting on” 
him. 
A man thus reprimanded, stood humiliated in the presence of all his peers. He could be so 
punished if he repeatedly mistreated his wife, violated market rules, or allowed his animals 
to destroy women’s crops. 
 
Effect of Colonialism on West African Women’s Political Structures 
 
Colonialism in West Africa allowed a foreign power to rule West African people without 
their permission. The European colonialists were able to take over West African land 
through military conquest. Colonialism did not value the world of the colonized. It divided 
the colonized society and rendered all its members weak. 
Colonialism marked beginning of end of any equality between sexes in village and politics. 
Women suffered the greatest loss of power. They were relegated to the background and 
could no longer take part in decision making. In non-centralized societies, opportunistic 
young men who befriended colonial masters were chosen to fill leadership positions as 
warrant chiefs, and the cases that previously went before women’s organizations, were now 
taken to the colonial courts. Except for Ahebi Ugbabe of colonial Nigeria, there were no 
women warrant chiefs, or members of courts. Women were not made court messengers, 
interpreters, clerks, or police women. 
The warrant chiefs were very corrupt. They constantly helped themselves to women’s 
agricultural produce and animals; and forced Igbo women into marriage without allowing 
them the customary right to refuse them. 
Women’s political organization lost prestige and members as their political and religious 
functions were replaced by colonial rule and Christianity. Clinics and foreign drugs replaced 
the need for rituals and sacrifices that women’s organizations undertook for welfare of 
village. 
The colonial governments banned self-help and the use of force by individuals or groups to 
bring wrong doers to justice. They also banned “sitting on a man.” The colonial 
environment did not allow for group solidarity amongst women, nor did it provide provision 
for dispersed leadership or shared power. 
The colonial masters laid claim to African land, privatizing and commercializing it, thus 
obstructing the traditional system of communal land ownership. They introduced crown 
grants which allowed men who wanted to purchase or own land to do so. The system not 
only made women’s ownership of land impossible, but restricted access to it for farming 
purposes. 
Colonialism eroded many of the economic avenues women had in traditional society. With 
the introduction of cash cropping for world markets, men were increasingly employed to 
work on farms, overlooking women, traditional cultivators, in the process. Colonialism 
brought about the importation of European goods, thus ruining traditional price fixing 
systems, another woman-controlled sector. 
With colonialism came Christianity and the introduction of western ideas and culture. The 
new faith attracted only a few converts to begin with. When West African women realized 
that western education was the key to political leadership, many more joined, so that their 
children would be allowed to attend missionary school. 
Church and school were synonymous, with classes held in church building. Girls had less 
access than boys to missionary education. These schools generally provided opportunities 
for education in vocations that were considered male, like carpentry and printing, thus 
excluding women in the process. The few girls that did attend missionary school were 
confined entirely to the private life of family. They were taught cooking, cleaning, child care, 
and sewing—the necessary domestic skills for Christian marriage and motherhood in their 
minds. This, unlike preparation which enabled them in pre-colonial culture to be involved in 
both private and public domains. 
Prejudices against West African women by the missionaries was in keeping with the 
Victorian ideology that a woman’s place was in home. They believed that women were frail 
minded and incapable of mastering the so-called masculine subjects. Moreover, Christian 
marriage introduced the title of “Mrs.” Which replaced the tradition of West African women 
going by their mother’s first name, further diffusing the validation of women. 
 
The Effect Colonialism on Igbo Women—The Women’s War or Ogu Umunwanyi of 1929 
Women “made war” in 1929 to call attention to a number of situations that adversely 
affected their interests as women. 
1. They believed that the British colonial government would institute direct taxation on 
them. In 1927, the British had instituted direct taxation on men. It was rumored that 
women would be taxed next. 
2. They “made war” in reaction to dramatic falling of palm oil prices due to the world 
depression. Food pricing was an Igbo woman-controlled venture; and before the 
institution of direct taxation on men in 1927, the official price of palm oil was 
between 12 and 13 shillings. The official price of mixed oil was between 9 and 10 
shillings for a four-gallon tin. The official price of palm kernels was between 7 and 8 
shillings for 50 pounds. In 1928, the price of palm oil fell to 7 shillings 5 pence. By 
1929, the price fell some more to 5 shillings 11 pence 
What did the women do? They decided to negotiate, which is a method that the women 
employed in pre-colonial times to right any wrong done them. Therefore, on December 30, 
1929, Igbo women held a mass meeting. They met with the District Officer and 
representatives of United Africa Company, John Holt, Russell’s etc. They demand a higher 
price for palm oil and kernels: “we have fixed a certain price for palm oil and kernels and if 
we get that we will bring them in. We want 10 shillings a tin for oil and 9 shillings a bushel 
for kernels.” 
3. They “made war” because of the high price of imported goods. In 1928, the duty on 
tobacco rose from 1 shilling 6 pence to 2 shillings in 1929. 
4. They “made war” because of the change in the method of purchase from measure to 
weight instituted by the colonial government. Igbo women were convinced that they 
were being cheated. 
5. Igbo women “made war” because the government had introduced an inspection of 
the women’s produce. 
6. Igbo women were enraged at the persecutions, extortions and corruption of the 
warrant chiefs and Native Court members. 
And last, but not least, 
7. Igbo women felt totally disregarded and disrespected by the colonial officials. 
It was these factors that fueled Igbo women’s anger, presenting a need to put the British 
colonialists in order. 
What happened? In Oloko area of Bende Division, the acting District Officer Mr. Cook asks 
warrant chief, Okogu to start counting adult males, females, children and animals. Warrant 
chief Okogu assigns this task to Emeruwa, who is his messenger. On November 23, 1929, 
Emeruwa goes to Nwanyereuwa’s house to ask her for this count. An angry Nwanyereuwa 
screams to him: “was your mother counted?” They seize each other by the throats, and a 
scuffle ensues. Nwanyereuwa raises an alarm. Coincidentally the women meeting at the 
market, to discuss this tax rumor. Nwanyereuwa bursts in and tells them what happened. 
This is an overt sign that they are indeed going to be taxed. Women thus send word to other 
women by sending palm twigs to women in neighboring villages asking them to come to 
Oloko. The significance of this action represented the war to come. These women in turn 
send palm fronds to other women. 
On November 24, the Oloko market is filled with women from far and near: 
One Sunday an alarm was raised, our attention was called to the fact the case had occurred, 
that is to say, what we had been anticipating had occurred. We all started that night for 
Oloko to see what had happened there. 
Once gathered, the women trooped to Niger Delta Pastorate Mission to demonstrate 
against Emeruwa: 
they danced and danced outside the Mission compound all night, eating and drinking palm 
wine and singing that Nwanyereuwa had been told to count her goats, sheep and people. 
From the Mission, they marched to Okogu’s compound, to ask him to explain why he had 
ordered them to pay tax. They ended up storming his compound, looting his property, and 
attacking his wives and servants. The method that the women employed was the method 
that they employed in the precolonial area to “make war,” or “sit on a man.” 
On November 26, the women went to Bende Divisional Headquarters to report the assault 
on Nwanyereuwa. The next day, Igbo women of Bende, Aba and Owerri Division assembled 
at Oloko, and refused to disperse until the acting District Officer Cook informed them that 
they would not be taxed. The women also insist that Okogu is arrested and removed as 
warrant chief. 
According to District Officer Captain Hill who had just returned from leave: 
The women numbering over 10,000 were shouting and yelling round the office in a frenzy. 
They demanded his cap of office, which I threw to them and it met the same fate as a fox’s 
carcass thrown to a pack of hounds. The station between the office and the Epsom and just 
round the office resembled Epsom Downs on Derby Day. The crowd extended right away 
through Bende Village and the pandemonium was beyond al belief. It took me two hours to 
get an opportunity of sending the wire asking for more police. 
The women left with written declaration that they will not be taxed. Okogu was arrested 
and sentenced to 2 years in prison. 
The colonial government thought that women would be appeased by this arrest. The 
reverse, however, occurred. News of Okogu’s imprisonment encouraged women who 
believed that they had scored a victory, and as a result, they stormed village after village. 
On December 12, they invaded Nguru, Okpuala, and Ngor and destroyed colonial court 
buildings and burnt all records. To prevent further destruction, the British colonial 
government deployed a mobile striking force. On December 13, colonial government sent 
dispatches out to Aba, Port Harcourt, Mbosi and Owerri. In Calabar Province, Ikot Ekpene, 
Abak and Opobo were attacked. Fire was opened and there were a number of casualties. 
All in all, over fifty women are killed and fifty were wounded. The effects were not positive 
for women. Politically, the British outlawed the warrant chief system and replace it with the 
“massed bench” system, which put a number of judges in power instead of one. The British 
also outlawed self-help and “making war” or “sitting on a man” 
Additionally, the colonial government sent a slew of anthropologists and ethnographers into 
the field to study Igbo political systems in order to make sure that nothing like the Women’s 
war ever happened again. The British sent colonial government anthropologists like C. K. 
Meek, Sylvia Leith-Ross, Margaret Green, and Ida Woods to study the Igbo. Thus, by the end 
of 1934, over 200 intelligence reports had been published.

12 - The Environment in West African History 
 
West Africa has been in contact with the outside world longer than any other part of Africa 
south of the Sahara and west of the boundary between Nigeria and Cameroon, a boundary 
that is one of Africa’s major physical and human divides. Africa and West-Africa in particular 
involuntarily supplied a significant amount of resources in slaves, minerals, as well as farm 
and forest produce. Again, in Africa, environmental issues have been a perennial concern 
for historical and physical geographers, anthropologists, archaeologists and medical 
scientists. Historians have discussed ways the physical environment and conditions have 
shaped the history and development of the people of Africa 
In this chapter, we shall look at the Historical antecedent of the physical environment, trace 
the origin of some major crops grown in the region, then lastly, soil and land management. 
 
THE HISTORICAL ANTECEDENT OF THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IN WEST AFRICA 
The land of West Africa consists of contrasting kinds of physical environment. The forest 
environment differs from the savanna environment, a mountainous area from a flat lowland 
area, riverine area from one away from a river, an area with predominantly sandy soils from 
one with predominantly loamy soils. Each kind of physical environment presents a peculiar 
set of problems or challenges which must be solved if people are to survive on the land. A 
farmer, for example, should take the physical characteristics of the land into serious 
consideration and devise suitable methods to ensure that he gets good results. He would 
probably perish or live a very simple and miserable life if he were unable to find ways of 
solving the problems of the physical environment. 
 
GEOLOGY 
West Africa, like most parts of Africa, is largely composed of Pre-Cambrian rocks, which 
have been folded and are often aligned from north- east to south-west, as is reflected in 
much of the relief. They are exposed over about one-third of west Africa or over two-thirds 
of the area south of 12o N and are part of the vast continental platform of Africa which in 
West Africa has an average elevation of about 400m (1,300ft). The oldest rocks may be 
about 4000 million years old. Some are metamorphosed sedimentary rocks, others are 
ancient volcanic and intrusive. 
Pre-Cambrian rocks have been variously subdivided, but their ages are uncertain as 
radioactive dating methods are not reliable with metamorphic rock. This oldest or lower 
Pre-Cambrian, comprises the Archaean or Dahomeyan and probably the Birmian system. 
The Archaean consists of highly metamorphosed rocks. Prevalent acidic types are mica 
schists, gneisses and quartzites, most are the product of the granitisation and 
metamorphism of original sediments. Basic rocks are garnrtiferous geneisse and 
amphiboite. Gneisses of similar composition are found in the Kasila series of Sierra Leone 
and others are known in Mauritania and Nigeria. 
The Birimian system occurs in southern Ghana and the Ivory Coast. The lower Birimian has 
folded and steeply dipping alternating grey-wacks and argillaceous beds, as well as some 
tuffs and lavas. The upper Birimian (Greenstones) consist mainly of volcanic rocks. The 
Kambui and Marampa schists of Sierra Leone may also be Birimian. 
 
RELIEF 
West Africa lies generally about 200m and 500m (600 to 600ft) and consists mainly of the 
worn monotonous and fairly level surfaces of the platform of Pre-Cambrian rocks. Higher 
relief may occur where trends in the ancient rocks can still be traced from the north-south 
hills of the Sierra Leone interior. Residual granite domes are common and the ‘Younger 
Granites’ are responsible for some bold relief, an example is the Jos Plateau in Nigeria. 
Certain series of the Pre-Cambrian give higher relief. An example is the several Birimian, 
Tarkwaian and Akwapim-Togo –Atacora ridges. 
 
DRAINAGE 
The drainage characteristics of West Africa may be summarized as follows: 
1. Rapid run off on crystalline rocks, especially on the south or south-western Pre-
Cambrian shield, where the rainfall is particularly heavy. 
2. Behind the south western and Guinea coasts, rivers are cutting down to new base 
levels, probably because of Miocene and later uplifts and inward tilting. Thus the 
Volta River is gaining at the expense of others. The Guinea Coast Rivers are 
frequently interrupted by rapids and deposit relatively little alluvium, except close to 
the shoreline. 
3. Greater maturity and indeterminate courses of the rivers of the sandy central 
lowland zone compared with the immaturity and vigor of the Guinea Coast Rivers. 
The Senegal, middle Niger and the upper reach of the Volta rivers have devious 
courses from the central zone. 
4. Great seasonal variations in river flow a seasonal rain causes extensive flooding eg. 
along the Central Niger. 
 
AGRICULTURE 
Agricultural pursuits are the basis of almost all West African life. As in any part of the world, 
important determinants of crop distribution are climate and soils. 
In the forest, crops have to be raised from small plots by periodic cutting and burning. Soil 
becomes exhausted and, as there is very little animal manure and artificial fertilisers are 
expensive and difficult to use satisfactorily in the tropics, there is no simple alternative to a 
long fallow period. Thus the forest farmer generally expends much energy per acre. Yet he is 
more than compensated by growth of permanent tree crops such as the cocoa, the oil palm, 
kola and coffee. 
By contrast, savanna farms are generally large and less varied in their crops, as the shorter 
growing periods restrict the farmer to one main crop unreliability of rainfall and lack of 
bumper harvest are challenges that may encourage more careful cropping. Population 
presence may also induce better farming, for example, the Kabrai of Togo, the Hausa 
around Kano and others. 
Inter cropping or double cropping is very common in West Africa. Although this method may 
seem inefficient and looks a muddle, it saves labour and land and limits soil erosion by 
keeping the ground covered. Moreover, some plants may benefit from inter-cropping. On 
the other hand mixed cropping may necessitate the use of crop varieties tolerant of this 
system. 
 
THE DISCOVERY OF COCOA 
The cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) originated in South America and its bean consumed as a 
drink by Mayans and Aztecs. Historians believe the Olmecs (first major civilization in 
Guatemala and Mexico) first discovered that the cocoa fruit was edible by observing rats 
eating it with gluttonous vigor. They soon realized the tree produced a fruit with a thousand 
flavors and nearly as many uses. 
Theobroma cacao. Wikipedia. CC BY 3.0. 
The Olmces (1500-400BC) were almost certainty the first humans to consume chocolate, 
originally in the form of a drink. They crushed the cocoa beans, mixed them with water and 
added spices, chillies and herbs (Coe’s Theory). They began cultivating cocoa in equatorial 
Mexico. Over time, the Mayans (6000 BC) and Aztecs (400 AD) developed successfully 
methods for cultivating cocoa as well. 
For these civilizations, cocoa was a symbol of abundance. It was used in religious ritual 
dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god responsible for bringing the cocoa tree to man to 
Chak ek Chuah, the Mayan patron saint of the cocoa and as an offering at the funerals of 
noblemen. Cocoa beans were also used as a form of currency in pre-Columbian Mexico. 
Cocoa production advanced as people migrated throughout Meso-America but consumption 
of the drink remained a privilege for the upper classes and for soldiers during battle. By this 
time, the re-invigorating and fortifying virtues of cocoa were becoming widely recognized 
and embraced. 
 
COMMERCIALIZATION OF COCOA (16TH CENTURY) 
In 1502, Columbus got his first glimpse of cocoa beans on a native canoe during a stop-over 
in Nicaragua, but he did not appreciate its awesome potential value. The true importance of 
this ‘brown gold’ was not recognized until Hernando Cortez drank it with the Aztec emperor 
Montezuma, and brought it back to the Spanish court in 1528 along with the equipment 
necessary for brewing the drink. Even then, it is unlikely anyone envisaged it ultimate 
importance as a world commodity. 
Following a victorious war against the Aztec empire and the downfall of the Aztec 
civilization, Cortez intensified cultivation efforts in New Spain, with the intention of 
developing a lucrative trade with Europe. 
The Spanish court soon fell under the spell of this exotic elixir and adapted it to their taste, 
adding cane sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and pepper. Initially Spain reserved cocoa for its 
exclusive use, carefully guarding its existence from the rest of the world. They were so 
successful keeping cocoa secret that when a group of English pirates captured a Spanish 
gallons, not recognizing the value of the weighty cargo of beans, they burned them! 
In 1585, the first cargo of cocoa beans arrived on the Iberian Peninsula from New Spain (the 
Spanish name for Mexico. This launched the trade in cocoa, and resulted in the 
establishment of the first chocolate shops, thus ushering in a new era of rapidly growing 
demand for this mysterious nectar from the new world. 
 
THE EARLY INTRODUCTION OF COCOA TO WEST AFRICA 
 The date of the first introduction of the Cacao tree to the British West African possessions is 
somewhat uncertain. The credit of having first brought the cacao tree from the New World 
to the African tropics undoubtedly goes to the Portuguese. They are reputed to have 
planted cacao on the island of Sao Tome (off the coast of Gabon) as far back as 1822. It was 
not until about 1870, however, that cultivation was undertaken seriously there. By 1895, the 
export of cocoa beans from this island had reached a million kilograms, which was a 
considerable quantity for those days. 
 
ORIGIN OF COCOA IN GHANA 
 With regard to the Gold Coast, which has been for many years the leading cocoa producer 
of West Africa, it is stated that in 1868 the Basel Mission at Akropong (in Akwapim, Eastern 
Province) had a few cacao trees growing in their grounds and that these were flourishing. It 
is also stated that in 1879 a native of Mampong (also in Akwapim) brought back pods from 
Fernando Po (an island off the Cameroons) where he had been working, and raised a few 
trees which he planted on his farm near that village. These trees are believed to have been 
the parent trees of the Gold Coast industry. Cultivation on the Gold Coast was greatly 
encouraged by Sir William Griffith, who was Governor from 1880 to 1895, and who 
established the botanic garden and experiment. 
 
ORIGIN OF COCOA IN NIGERIA 
 In Nigeria, the position is very similar to that of the Gold Coast. For cocoa is alleged to have 
been first introduced there by a native chief called "Squiss Banego" in 1874—also from 
Fernando Po. He established a cocoa farm in the Bonny district and cultivation spread. By 
1887-9 a few plantations had been established by European companies, those of the Royal 
Niger Company at Abutshi and Onitsha being taken over by the Government of South 
Nigeria in 1900. 
It is thus apparent that the cacao of both the Gold Coast and Nigeria was derived from a 
common source—Fernando Po. From which part of the American tropics the Portuguese 
obtained their seed or plants in the early part of last century there appears to be no record, 
but it is probable that they would have come from Pará in the Amazon region, or from other 
parts of Brazil. 
 
ORIGIN OF COCOA IN SIERRA LEONE 
In Sierra Leone the cacao in cultivation is conceded to be of a different type from that in 
general cultivation in the Gold Coast and Nigeria. This raises the question of the origin of 
Sierra Leone cacao. In this connection it may be of interest to note that among old records 
at Kew is one of young cacao plants being sent to Glasgow Botanic Garden for shipment to 
West Africa on the 30th August, 1864. Unfortunately, there are no details as to the ultimate 
destination of the plants and how they fared. However, it is probable that at this early 
period they would have been consigned to Freetown and not to any other part of West 
Africa. As the voyage is a comparatively short one it is quite probable the plants survived 
and ultimately became established in Sierra Leone. At about this time, economically 
productive plants of various kinds, including cacao, were constantly sent from Kew to such 
far off places as the botanic gardens at Brisbane and at Durban and usually survived the long 
voyage. There was free intercourse and exchange of plants between Kew and the West 
Indies at this period and the probability is that the cacao plants dispatched from Kew in 
1864 were raised from West Indian seed and were not of Brazilian origin as is believed to be 
the case with the early introductions to the Gold Coast and Nigeria. 
There is thus the interesting probability that the present day cocoa of West Africa (apart 
from recent introductions at experiment stations) is of dual origin, that of the Gold Coast 
and Nigeria having originated from Brazil and that of Sierra Leone from the West Indies. 
 
DISCOVERY OF KOLA NUT IN WEST AFRICA 
Kola nut is the seed kernel of a large African tree grown commercially around the world, 
particularly in Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Brazil and other parts of South America. It is 
extremely popular amongst the inhabitants as a caffeine-containing stimulant. The nuts are 
eaten whole or powdered and mixed with liquid for a drink. 
The kola nut is primarily derived from three species from the cocoa tree family, Cola 
acuminta, Cola nitida and Cola vera, which originate in tropical West Africa but can also be 
found in pockets of Brazil and the West Indies, where they were taken by captives on the 
trans-Atlantic slave trade. The trees typically reach a height of 25 meters or 60 feet, and its 
waxy oval leaves frame cheerful star-shaped flowers that are white or yellow with purple 
accents. Its fruit is pod-shaped, each of which is nestled about a dozen roundish shaped 
seeds or kola nuts. The kola nuts may be red, white or pinkish of hue. The nut’s aroma is 
sweet and rose-like; and the first taste is bitter, but sweetens upon chewing. The nut can be 
boiled to extract the cola.

The Many Roles of the Kola Nut 
Its versatility as a symbol, medicine, food and flavoring has been long been utilized around 
the world since ancient times and continues to be so applied. Science has isolated certain 
compounds within it, which can be credited with its medicinal benefits. 
Symbolic Uses 
As a symbol it is used in West Africa by the Igbos of Nigeria, Senegambia, Ghana among 
other countries to grace social rituals of hospitality as welcome offerings to guests; as 
sacred offering in religious rites and prayers; in ancestor veneration; and in important life 
events such as weddings, naming ceremonies, funerals and memorials. As a mark of respect 
the kola nut is broken with knife. Prayer follows the presentation of kola nut immediately, 
which in traditional pattern is with libations. In the prayer our forefathers are beckoned to 
come and participate in the eating of the kola nut and to guide and protect in the mission 
that brings the people together. After the prayer, the kola nut is broken, shared, everybody 
eats and the ceremony begins. 
Medicinal Uses 
The kola nut is high in caffeine as well as a number of other phyto-chemical compounds 
including betaine (a natural red pigment), kola red, phenolics, tannins, theobromine and 
theophylline. Its bitter astringent flavor is used as digestive aid prior to meals to stimulate 
gastric juice and bile production; while its caffeine and theobromine content make it a 
potent neuro-stimulant that is used to combat fatigue. The nut and its extracts have been 
also successfully used in treating respiratory conditions such as asthma and whooping cough 
as its caffeine, theobromine and theophylline content act as vasodilators that dilate the 
blood vessels, allowing for greater circulation of oxygen. Other medicinal uses include the 
treatment of toothache, diarrhea, exhaustion, headaches, hunger (the caffeine content 
means it is an effective appetite suppressant), malaria, nausea, poison antidote, sedative, 
and as a stimulant and tonic. 
As Food and Flavoring For Drinks 
You will find often West African manual workers, laborers and farm workers chewing kola as 
they go about their daily work as a pep-me-up in between meals, although the practice is 
said to be dwindling amongst the younger generation. Nonetheless, the kola nut is still used 
as a type of aperitif prior to meals to enhance the taste of the food to follow, as its 
astringency cleanses the palate and stimulates saliva production. Nutritionally, it is a source 
of some B-vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin), as well as proteins, starch and sugar. 
Muslims in Africa often substitute it for alcohol as their religion forbids them to drink and, 
although it contains 1-3.5% caffeine, it is not addictive. It is the distinctive source of flavor 
for colas, and certain soft drinks and tonics. 
Coca Cola Drink 
In May of 1886, Dr. John Styth Pemberton, a pharmacist from Georgia, USA took extracts of 
the kolanut and coca, mixed them with sugar, carbonated water and caramel coloring to 
create the first Coca-Cola recipe. Since then it has been used as flavoring in many other soft 
drinks - although Coca-Cola purportedly does not used kola nut anymore, but uses instead 
synthetic derivatives that mimic its flavors. 
Negative Effects Of Kola Nut 
Regular daily chewing of the kola nut can stain the teeth giving a telling rusty color. 
According to medical science, kola nut does have a high level of nicotine, which can affect 
body chemistry negatively. It can lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, high heartbeat, 
high-level toxicity, over stimulations and locomotive effects. However, despite some of 
these negative medical reports, the kolanut is a cherished commodity that has blossomed 
into a huge economic prospect with kolanut exportation to China, North America and India, 
where it is largely required for the production of cola drinks and pharmaceutical products. 
 
SOIL AND LAND MANAGEMENT 
The African cultivator in particular and the tropical cultivator in general have frequently 
been portrayed as wasteful, even destructive, exploiters of biological resources, especially in 
relation to tropical forests. This view, if not completely unjustified, is certainly a gross 
oversimplification of the actual situation. Indigenous systems based on the cultivation of 
small areas for short periods, and the subsequent development of a natural fallow, are 
conservative of biological resources, for the following major reasons: 
1. Only small patches are cultivated. This is probably a consequence of the labour 
involved in clearing forest, but has the effect of introducing only minimal disturbance 
of the plant-soil system, of reducing the effect of increased run-off by constricting 
the distance over which movement of material is possible, and of limiting 
disturbance microclimatic effects. 
2. Cultivation lasts only for a short period, which may be two or three years, or a little 
longer, after which the plot is allowed to revert to natural fallow. The reason for this 
reversion has commonly been supposed to be ‘’loss of fertility’ but there is 
considerable doubt that this is so, at least, in itself. Nutrient supply by the soil does 
not, in many areas at least, decrease as rapidly in successive years as had once been 
assumed. The measurable amounts of nutrients in the soil, though low by standard 
in higher latitudes. ( if the more fertile areas are used for the comparison), may not 
truly indicate the availability if those nutrients to plants. The activity of the soil water 
regime characteristic of forest areas for much of the year, and for the wet season in 
much of the rest of tropical West Africa, probably ensures maximum solution and 
dissociation of nutrient ions during the growing season of the crop plant. It is likely 
that weed problem play a significant role in the decision to abandon a cultivation 
plot. 
3. Many large trees are not cleared, the stools of smaller trees are left in the ground, 
and the roots are rarely disturbed significantly, particularly in their lower extensions. 
This means that considerable quantities of organic matter continue to be supplied to 
the soil while cultivation proceeds, and that as soon as the regeneration of stools 
and roots ceases to be prevented by the abscission of the aerial shoots in the 
process of weeding, vigorous growth of these plants takes place. Furthermore, under 
the woody fallow, restoration of the nutrient and organic matter equilibria in the soil 
is rapidly achieved. Related to this is the fact the seven or eight years is usually a 
sufficient length of time for the woody fallow to accumulate nutrients in amounts 
adequate for renewed cultivation. 
4. In the process of cultivation, the indigenous cultivator leaves a considerable number 
of adventitious plants growing with his crops. These are rarely weeds, which are by 
definition useless to the cultivator, but self-sown plants which have a technological, 
medicinal or food use to the indigenous community. They have the effect of 
providing a cover of ground which conserves moisture, intercepts heavy rainfall, and 
supplies some organic matter to the soil. 
5. Finally, a significant proportion of forest clearing for food crop cultivation is 
undertaken with the intention of establishing more permanent managed 
ecosystems, which include cocoa, oil palm, rubber and other tree crops. These, 
despite their much greater simplicity compared to developed forest, are analogous 
to it in respect of a number of basic ecological relationships, and represent an 
essentially conservative form of land use in the tropical forests. 
SOIL EROSION AND WATER CONTROL 
Soil erosion is not a general problem in West Africa under indigenous husbandry systems. It 
is, however, locally a chronic problem, and in many areas a potential hazard under changing 
cultivation practices. Soil erosion is intimately associated with problems of water control 
and desertification, and it is thus convenient to consider both together.

Over much of tropical Africa the annual water supply from precipitation is less than the 
amount of water most crop plants would transpire if adequately supplied with moisture. 
Furthermore, over much of this area the rainfall is unreliable in amount and occurrence, 
both seasonally and annually. Also it is commonly very intense. Thus conservation measures 
must involve efficient use of the available moisture, and the prevention of the adverse 
effect of intense rainfall, such as flash floods. A special section has been created in this 
chapter to discuss the drought at the Sahel region. 
Maintaining a plant cover and mulching, separately or together, constitute one approach to 
the problem, but the preservation of useless plants simply as a conservation measure 
involves the waste of moisture which might otherwise go the crop plant, and is feasible only 
in areas where the water supply is more or less adequate to the being grown. Mulching with 
dead plant matter is also not usually practicable, since there are other more pressing uses 
for such materials as straw, plant stems and leaves, which might be used for conservation of 
this type. Artificial mulches, such as bitumen-in-water, though practicable, are not usually 
economically or technically possible in the present socio-economic situation in areas where 
such measures are most needed. 
Contour and tie-ridging effectively achieve conservation of water supplies, and a diminution 
of runoff velocities. The combination of the two has proved their worth. These measures 
offer simple and satisfactory ways of controlling water use and preventing soil erosion, but 
soil differences still need to be taken into account. The importance of such measures cannot 
be overemphasized, and always involve major schemes of rehabilitation, embracing 
engineering works, afforestation, considerable modifications of traditional agricultural 
practices, even of settlement patterns and land apportionment. These imply considerable 
expense of money and of expertise which could otherwise be used for agricultural 
improvement, rather than for arresting the effects of past malpractices. Rainfall variability, 
and prolonged drought have been major environmental issues disturbing the African 
continent. On the more western part, while the Sahel region has had a long reputation of 
extreme drought conditions, most West-African countries have historically suffered from 
environmental challenges. For the past thirty years, inconsistencies in rainfall and high levels 
of variability have negatively affected agriculture. Rainfall provides the moist nature of soil 
and aids in its aeration encouraging massive agriculture production. Concerning rice 
production, it has had the tendency of causing fluctuations in production in countries like 
Sierra Leone and Gambia. The major climatic condition that has negatively impacted the 
agricultural activities of the West African regions is drought. This environmental 
phenomenon has persisted since the 1960s with the early 1980s and 70s witnessing the 
worst conditions of it. This drought had systematically altered the kind of food crops 
cultivated in the regions whiles drastically reducing the production of other crops. Examples 
include sorghum, millet and rice.In Gambia, farmers had claimed that, the droughts had 
altered the rains negatively. Rainfall in this country and other Sahelian states has being the 
main source of irrigational water for their crops. Considerably, Agricultural produce had 
increased in the 1950s and 60s due to the favourable rains in this period, however the late 
1960s and early 70s saw the decline of the rains. In the southern part of the country, 
farmers claimed rains in the month June of the 70s were low comparing it to that of the 
1950s. The rains in the latter had only last for a month. The major crop which has been 
affected by these droughts is rice. Rice has been the major staple of countries like Sierra 
Leone, Gambia and most Sahelian States. In Gambia about 20-30% of lands are converted to 
upland rice cultivation. Primarily, its production has been dominated by women serving as 
major source of income. Since the inception of this environmental phenomenon, rice 
production has declined approximately half of what use to be produced. This has led to 
most indigenes relying on exported ones. The major setback here is the reduced rains which 
has also in turn reduced run-off to the main lands of rice plantations. Generally, rivers have 
also dried due to this same issue. 
Other major staples which have been affected by the drought are millet, sorghum and 
groundnuts. The cultivation patterns of these crops have increasingly been determined by 
natural rains. With the advent of the drought, Men have opted for Lands which are rich and 
moisture which can sustain the cultivation of the crops. This action has led to increasing 
degrading activities in regions like Burkina Faso, Mali and Gambia. The desire to farm in 
areas closer to water bodies has also led to water pollution. Statistically, poor and erratic 
rainfall in many years 
since 1968 has brought about reduced yields of these crops in the countries and has 
reduced the potential germination of seeds. Particularly the seeds of millet and sorghum 
have suffered a great deal from this instance. 
Ghana just like many other tropical countries is very much vulnerable to climate change and 
variability. An estimated 35 percent of the total land mass is desert and since the 1980s the 
has been increasing desertification of the northern part of the country. Desertification in 
Ghana is currently estimated to be proceeding at a rate of 20,000 hectares per annum 
thereby compromising water resource. n northern Ghana, these farmers are usually 
involved in the cultivation of staple grains including maize, 
rice, millet, sorghum, soybean, cowpea and groundnut, and also engage in the rearing
 of small ruminants such as sheep and goat. 
 
CONCLUSION 
The soils of Africa vary widely in their characteristics and behavior in relation to plant 
growth, and in their response to various agricultural practices. Nevertheless, discernible 
spatial pattern may be clearly seen on different scales, and thus afford the basis upon which 
subsequent rational development of the resources may be built. Increasing production from 
already productive areas and developing as yet unused areas of land is possible, given 
adequate local knowledge of soil character, and its satisfactory representation on an 
understandable map, as well as the technical knowledge which is available as a tool for the 
development of agriculture from the essentially conservative indigenous systems to more 
ambitious uses. This involves, as Sir Joseph Hutchinson has pointed out ‘the domestication 
of the soil as [man] has domesticated plants and animals’. This is already in progress, and 
much current soils in the tropics have been developed in Western Europe. Concerning this 
development, an understanding of the basic characteristics and distribution of the soil 
would make a major contribution. 
 
DROUGHT IN THE SAHEL 
Africa has been affected by series of challenges which ranges from high rate of poverty to 
conflicts and war among others. Environmental hazards have been one of the challenges 
confronting the African continent. Droughts continue to feature greatly in these 
environmental hazards. It is defined as a long period of little or no rain. Though all regions 
have enjoyed a considerable amount of drought, the Sahel region continues to top the chart 
so far as this environmental hazard is concern. The Sahel is a strip of Land that stretches 
across 12 countries including Chad, Mauritania, Niger, Mali, Senegal, Cameroon, Gambia, 
Somalia and Ethiopia. It is geographically situated at the South of the Sahara Desert. The 
region witnessed its extreme drought in periods prior to 1820 and 1840. This had remerged 
again in the 1980s with effects greater as compared to the period stated above. 
Climatologists and Scientists have predicted that these drought conditions can last for 
several decades. Tied to the issue of drought in West Africa is the variation of rainfall 
patterns or the dry spells. The dry spell is defined as the Sequence occurrence of 
consecutive days with precipitation lower than 1mm. considerably, the uniformity of rainfall 
in the Sahel Regions have fluctuated over time. Rains in the month of August which peaks 
rainfall in the region, has been falling considerably according to the Meteorologist Mike 
Dennet. What are the possible causes of this?

Causes of the Increasing Rate of Drought and Minimum Rainfall in West Africa 
Changes in Sea Surface Temperature 
The West African Monsoon westerly (WAM) has been the main source of rainfall in the 
Sahel. The reduction of the WAM have caused the onset of the droughts experienced in the 
1960s. Between 1930 and 2000, the region has encountered the weak WAM which has 
resulted in the southward shift in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This in turn 
has decreased moisture input which acts as an agent of vegetation growth. The long lasting 
effect has been less vegetation and high albedo. 
Moreover, the repercussions of the El Nino weather pattern which is of the warm waters in 
the Pacific Ocean have also played a part in the Sahel’s dry spell. This has also caused the 
northward shift of the mean sea level pressure along the coast of West Africa hence 
creating dry conditions over the Sahel. 
 The Declining Vegetation Cover 
The declining vegetation cover has been caused by overgrazing and the conversion of 
woodland into agricultural lands, and has caused increase in the albedo of the landscape. 
This has reduced the amount of moisture in the atmosphere resulting in a lower probability 
of rainfall in the region. The overreliance on wood as the sole means of fuel in the region 
has also largely contributed to devegetation. 
Human Induced Climate Change 
Human-induced climate is mainly concerned with human activities such as deforestation 
and land degradation through various unsustainable methods of cultivation and the 
sweeping Green Houses Gases such as Carbon Dioxide. Sahel’s CO2 rate has increased at a 
rate of 2.2% between 1960 and 2006. According to Epule and Peng this is associated with 
the 28% increase in population. Hence people are encroaching the areas that were initially 
uninhabited. This has contributed to ripping the region of the little vegetation it is left with. 
Effects of Sahel’s Drought 
The major impact of the drought in the Sahel is the drastic decline of tree species in the 
region. The major tree species in the region is the Acacia tree. Other species include 
Commiphora africana, Balanites aegyptiaca, Faidherbia albida, and Boscia senegalensis. 
These trees are the major reducing agent of CO2 in the atmosphere. In Senegal, the average 
number of trees present reduced from 64 ± 2 in 1945 to 43 ± 2 in 2005. Their decline 
inversely has increased the rate of CO2 in the atmosphere. Other effects have to do with the 
surge of famine in the region. Poor nutrient nature of the soil has resulted in poor yield of 
major staples of the region. The food sufficiency had dropped from 98% to 25 % between 
1960 and 1985. In Sudan, famine had affected close to about 20-25 million people with 3% 
month death rate. Staple food crops such as millet and sorghum yields have also dropped to 
about 20% from the normal. 
The inconsistencies in rainfall statistics and little attention being paid to other atmospheric 
data and conditions responsible for drought in the Sahel region have made drought 
predictability difficult. There is a need for more studies on these atmospheric behaviors 
concerning the drought. Keen attention can be paid to what time span constitute the 
drought and what should drought’s threshold hold; this will aid in proffering a better 
solution to the seeming unending phenomenon. 
Moreover some positive changes are now taking place which show how concerted action by 
West African governments can make a difference. The government of Senegal instituted a 
major tree-planting initiative along the River Senegal (at the border with Mauritania). This 
has led to increased vegetation and crop production or the first time for many decades. 
Thus history shows the relation of West African history to environmental patterns, but also 
the potential to change the trend for the better with concerted social action and historical 
awareness of these factors.

13 – Conclusion: Future Directions for Students and 
Teachers 
 
The WASSCE History examination is designed to give students a sound grounding in the 
regional history of West Africa. It introduces students to many important themes: 
 
1, the methods through which the past can be studied; 
2, the layers of changes which have shaped the region to be as it is today; 
3, precolonial history as it relates to Islam, Atlantic and Saharan Trade, Economic History and 
the History of slavery; 
4, colonial history as it relates to the Scramble for Africa by European colonisers, resistance, 
and independence; 
5, postcolonial questions relating to the difficulties of independence and the relationship of 
West African nations to world organisations. 
 
This syllabus goes together with the national histories which students must take in each 
country which sits the WASSCE exam. The combination is important. A regional understanding 
is vital for the following aims: 
1, building bridges between different countries; 
2, understanding what is held in common; 
3, and thereby to build a common shared future path of peace and prosperity. 
 
This path will be much harder without this shared understanding. This is why the regional 
paper is so important – not only in terms of passing the exam, but also in terms of the 
knowledge that it can bring. 
 
History can be seen as a “useless subject”, one that is not going to help in making your way in 
a difficult world. Yet History is also the foundation of a number of other subjects: a historical 
understanding can help in a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to): 
Environmental Change; Economic Development; Urban infrastructure; Health Policy; Political 
relations of West Africa to the world. 
 
Thus a thorough grounding in H istory can help to shape a deeper understanding of some of 
the problems which arise in very different fields, and which are vital to the future of West 
African countries. The WASSCE syllabus offers this grounding: it is not just a programme with 
the exam as an end point, but also a beginning for building new awareness of the historical 
origins of the problems of today. 
 
Thus this textbook does not pretend to be comprehensive, and nor should it be. It invites 
future questions, by teachers and students alike; and from these future questions, new 
insights can emerge into what matters in the West African past, and how teachers and 
students in West Africa can shape this understanding. 
 
The authors of this textbook want to be very clear. For too long, the study an d analysis of 
West African history has been shaped by concerns and funding mechanisms located outside 
of West Africa. They hope that this textbook can offer a platform for the generation of new 
questions and criticisms which are much closer to the historic al interests and needs of 
students and teachers who sit the WASSCE exam. 
 
That also means that this textbook is a work in progress. The authors do not consider it 
completed, and welcome questions and comments as to how it can be improved and what 
materials and topics might also be covered. 
 
We are aware, for instance, that while the European presence in Africa has been addressed, 
the many African influences in shaping global cultures have not been discussed. This is vital 
in shaping an understanding of Afri can contributions to world history, and the reciprocal 
dynamics which have shaped and continue to shape the world. For just a few examples: 
1, Recent research has shown the influence which Africans had from the 16th century onwards 
in developing agricultural technologies, social structures, and also forms of music and dance 
in the Americas; 
2, Folk songs still sung in southern Portugal today derive from oral narratives of the Guinea -
Bissau region; 
3, Some of the artistic motifs used in earlier times were linked to sculptors in Sierra Leone. 
 
Similarly, there is a need to understand histories of health in the region, to see how 
indigenous knowledge systems and Western medicine have overlapped . This is especially 
relevant in the area of medical infrastructure laboratory research, as well as diverse colonial 
and post-colonial responses to diseases, epidemics and pandemics in the regions of Africa and 
beyond. There are other essential themes like medical racism, colonialism and imperialism 
which must be loudly explored in the Senior High School literature . This will ensure the 
consciousness about the need to encourage extension and expansion of the knowledge o f 
science, technology and medicine within the space of history. It will also enable students and 
teachers to critique t he evolving of African states within the broader context of Africa’s 
interaction with Europe. 
 
It is also pertinent to emphasize that thi s textbook highlights the continuities and 
discontinuities within the history of the African people and projects further to make the 
subject relevant to contemporary times. Again, the authors believe that, this is a living 
document and must evolve with add itions and continuous fine -tuning when it is necessary. 
The historiography of African history has crossed the borders of what would be referred to as 
“traditional histories” to other specialised themes in medicine, science and to a larger degree 
interdisciplinary research and writing. With this understanding among other things, we 
believe that the story of the African people must be told to reflect their own ontology, 
epistemology among others. 
 
On this note, we envisage that this resource will serve as a teaching and learning tool as well 
as an agency to develop the interest for the writing of African history that has much relevance 
to the African people in the first instance and also to the wider world in the second instance.
